# OpenVnmrJ

OpenVnmrJ is the open-sourced parts of Varian and Agilent's VnmrJ 4.2, now owned by the University of Oregon and is free and open-source software.
Read more about OpenVnmrJ and the history of VnmrJ at [Background](http://openvnmrj.org/Background).  

OpenVnmrJ does not contain console software, example FIDs, NMRPipe or ChemPack, however during installation, these will be copied from your existing
VnmrJ 4.2 into the OpenVnmrJ directory. The /vnmr symlink will be changed to point to OpenVnmrJ and your existing VnmrJ 4.2 installation will be untouched.

Never delete the Agilent supplied VnmrJ 4.2 on a spectrometer computer because Agilent service will require the original VnmrJ 4.2.

If you want to use or test OpenVnmrJ, download the release appropriate for your OS, see below.
