OpenVnmrJ Release Notes.

May 2018
    makefid could fail if called many times, such as when creating a 2D or
      arrayed 1D data set.
    dpcon can now be cancelled.
    fidmax could fail if makefid is used to make a new fid.
    seqgen could generate many warnings from "dps extensions"
    Added scalefid command (see manual/scalefid)
    Added ovjGetpipe to download and install NMRPipe
      ovjGetpipe -h 
      will display a manual
    Added ovjPasswd to generate "operator" passwords. 
    Converted nextexp into a command and documented it.
    Added icon and hide options to vnmrj (see manual/vnmrj)
    Added writespectrum and readspectrum commands (see manual/writespectrum)
    CPMG preparation option in all liquids sequences (Thanks to John Ryan).
    The dousermacro now supports return values
    Bug fixed in vjreplaceQ (the “buggy” version did not maintain the automation
      time when a nightQ is removed from an errored location – Thanks to Ken Knott
      for reporting this bug).
    cft2da/cft1da macros are included. They allow processing of craft2D results
      outside of craft tools.
    Posted the native MacOS version of OpenVnmrJ on the OpenVnmrJ github site at
      https://github.com/OpenVnmrJ/OpenVnmrJ/releases . This version was built
      for java version 1.8. With small modifications, it also will run with
      java version 1.6 and java version 9.

Mar 2018
    Study queue errors fixed

Oct 2017
    Fixed some faults discussed in SpinSights.
      3D gradient shimming can fail with an uninitialized $isvnmrj variable

Sep 2017
    Fixed some faults discussed in SpinSights.
      improved atcmd 'active' option documentation
      Print Screen to a file would fail if no plotter is defined.
      BioPack calibrations failed if VT unit is switched off.
      Added chainProshim (see manual/chainProshim)
      Added menu feature to UserPrefs (see manual/UserPrefs)
      Fixed svpdp to follow operator rights when making changes

Aug 2017
    Fixed scripts used to install OpenVnmrJ. The standard sudo is now
    used. Linux obsoleted kudzu so we no longer need to deal with it.
    Also copy some rpms to the dvd for installation (tcl and tk)
    
Aug 2017
    Add ovjUser script to add user information to OVJ's user admin
    files in /vnmr/adm. This can be used in lieu of the OVJ admin
    interface.  See the comments in the /vnmr/bin/ovjUser script.

Jul 2017
    Include Bayes programs with CRAFT, courtesy of Joe Ackerman
    and Larry Bretthorst of Washington University.
    Added source code for FdfToDcm (FDF to Dicom) imaging program.
    makefid now has a 'rev' option to reverse the spectrum.
    chkname can now expand to 511 characters instead of 255.
    Updated with ChemPack 8 bug fixes and improvements.
    Updated with ChemPack 8 including new macros that:
       addarray - allows multiple arrayed FIDs to be added
       dndNUS - similar to dndfid for NUS data
       pi3ssb, pi4ssb, pi6ssb - shifted sine bell weighting functions
       pi3ssbsq, pi4ssbsq, pi6ssbsq - shifted sine bell squared weighting functions

Jun 2017
    Plot preview could cause OpenVnmrJ to exit with
    an "environment nesting" error

Mar 2017
    Two macros would report errors when starting in background mode.
    One error was about system not being an acquisition system.
    The other error was that the file enterQ did not exist

Mar 2017
    The  makefid, ddf, noise, getdatadim, and ilfid programs would fail
    if the length of the pathname was larger than 128 characters.
    Increased length limit to 256 characters, which is what most
    other programs use.

Mar 2017
    If Vnmrbg was running in server mode, it would exit after receiving
    its first message on its server listening socket.

Mar 2017
    Could not safely abort a background Vnmrbg. Now, kill -2 <pid>
    or a Cntrl-C will do it.

Mar 2017
    Problem with numeric operators names
    If an operators name is a number, loading a ".rec" file
    resulted in "can't compare STRING with REAL" error.
    Bug and work-around reported in SpinSights

Jan 2017:
    ds program may show the wrong spectrum
    If an arrayed data set has more than nine traces
    and the  vertical scale (vs) or vertical position (vp)
    is interactively updated, alternating traces will be
    displayed. The integral could also be wrong.

Jan 2017
    makeuser creates menujlib instead of obsolete menulib in user accounts
    The menulib was phased out several years ago. Graphics menus are
    now held in menujlib

Jan 2017
    Solids PSG error in solidmpseqs.h
    Pulse sequences using Lee-Goldburg decoupling, as in a t1rho array,
    fail to start. They give a segmentation violation. There was an
    uninitialized variable. Bug reported in SpinSights.

Jan 2017
    Linear prediction error with large number of increments
    Data with a large number of increments may not process correctly.
    One gets a lpext1<1 or lpext2<1 error. Bug reported in SpinSights.

Jan 2017
    sread could fail to convert parameters whose name is more than
    eight characters.

Dec 2016
    The vnmrj startup script failed on Ubuntu systems. A sh script
    does not support the "source" feature supported by bash scripts.

Oct 2016
    Some Linux packages required in the Ubuntu environment were not
    being installed.

Sep 2016 *****************
    OpenVnmrJ 1.1A release 

Sep 2016
    Added ovjapps and ovjsubmit features to enable retrieving and submitting
    appdirs to the OpenVnmrJ software package. See
    /vnmr/openvnmrj-utils/manual/ovjapps and
    /vnmr/openvnmrj-utils/manual/ovjsubmit

Aug 2016
    Additional improvements for building OpenVnmrJ on MacOS systems.

Aug 2016
    The OpenVnmrJ build process includes the git commit ID and checksums
    of all the files. These are stored in the /vnmr/adm/sha1 directory.

Aug 2016
    go('check') was failing on MacOS

Aug 2016
    Incorporated the VnmrJ 4.2A "110" patch corrections into OpenVnmrJ

Aug 2016
    Installation of OpenVnmrJ on Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS could fail.
    This was tracked down to some file permissions issues for items
    in maclib.

Aug 2016
    Automation runs could fail. Autoproc was not removing entries from psgQ
    autofuncs.c used the tail command to remove lines from psgQ. However,
    without the -n option, the +12 was interpreted as a file name, causing
    tail to add a filename to psgQ. This bug may affect VnmrJ 4.2A when
    it is installed on newer Linux versions.

Aug 2016
    Use dynamic libraries for MacOS psglib programs. This simplifies
    updating PSG on MacOS systems and significantly reduces the size
    of the PSG programs.

July 2016
    Use clang compiler for MacOS builds.

July 2016
    Incorporated VnmrJ 4.2A at the "109" patch level.
