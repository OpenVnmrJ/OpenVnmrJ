DESCRIPTION

Host Computer Channel Programs

The underlying paradigm of the channel programs is the Host Computer is the
client and the Console is the server.  The host computer calls connect; the
console programs call listen and accept.  Recall the connect call always
returns immediately while the accept call normally blocks the calling program
until a remote partner calls connect.

When the host is ready to complete a channel connection, it contacts the
Connection Broker on the console.  The Broker maintains a list of which
channels in the console are ready to accept a remote connection.  We expect
the console programs to start first, activating their side of the channels 
first.  Then the host computer programs start, complete the connection and
each channel is ready for use.

Suppose however the host computer starts first.  Two things can happen.  If
the Connection Broker is not ready, then the initial attempt to contact it
will fail.  See contact_remote_cb.  Not much can be done here; the host has
to try again.  The other possibility is the connection broker is ready, but
the channel itself is not.  In this situation the connectChannel call fails
with `errno' set to ESRCH.  The application then knows to either quit or
(more likely) wait a set amount of time and try again.

INTERNAL

Initially I adopted the following strategy:  The host computer then sends a
message saying, in effect, ready when you are.  Then for this channel the
paradigm reverses.  The host becomes the server and the console becomes the
client.  When the console side of the channel is ready, it sends a message
to this effect to the host computer.  The host then knows it can complete
the connection.

Unfortunately this takes a lot of program to implement.  Furthermore those in
the project who write applications using the channel programs seem of the
opinion that it is not required.  An alternate is sufficent, as follows:
If the console is not ready, the connectChannel call fails with `errno' set
to ESRCH.  The application then knows to either quit or (more likely) wait a
set amount of time and try again.

I wrote some programs to implement the first strategy.  At this time they are
not being used.  Each is being kept in the event we decide to proceed with
this strategy, but it not being compiled thru the use of a compiler switch.


Compile-time switches:

Set NOASYNC to exclude asynchronous channel programs.  You get these programs
by default, but they require the asynchronous event system, eventHandler.c,
eventQueue.c and listObj.c, to link successfully.

Set DEBUG_ASYNC to get useful information about asynchronous channels.
