DESCRIPTION
This library provides a shared memory interface with a mutual
excusion semaphore.

Interface provided:

  SHR_MEM_ID  shrmCreate(char *filename,int keyid, unsigned long size);
  void shrmRelease(SHR_MEM_ID shrmid);
  char *shrmAddr(SHR_MEM_ID shrmid);
  void shrmTake(SHR_MEM_ID shrmid);
  void shrmTake(SHR_MEM_ID shrmid);
  void  shrmShow(SHR_MEM_ID shrmid);
 
 In creating a share memory segment between two processes, the
SAME filename and keyid MUST BE Used by both processes.

  Typical scenerio:

     shrmid = shrmCreate("/home/MyShrMemImage", 42,
	                   sizeof(my_struct_to_be_shared));
     shared_struct=(my_struct_to_be_shared)shrmAddr(shrmid);

     -- don't need to lock when reading single element --
     val = shared_struct->a_member_of_struct;

     -- but I do when writing to struct ---
     shrmTake(shrmid);  take mutex
     shared_struct->another_member_of_struct = newValue;
     shrmGive(shrmid);  give mutex back
