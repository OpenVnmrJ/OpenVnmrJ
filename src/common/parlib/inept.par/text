                     INEPT   EXPERIMENT

j     coupling constant (0 allows entry of d2,d3)
pw    90 degree pulse on observe nucleus
pp    90 degree pulse on protons using decoupler
mult  multiplicity; 0 gives a normal experiment (d1-pw-at sequence);
      2 selects ch's (doublets); 3 gives ch2's down, ch's and ch3's up;
      4 enhances all protonated carbons
dm    'ny' gives decoupled spectrum; 'nn' gives coupled spectrum
focus 'y' gives refocussing for coupled spectrum (decoupled spectra are
      always refocussed)
normal 'y' gives normal multiplets in coupled spectra

Remember: delay "d1" is needed for protons to relax
