Satellite file format for FIDDLE
================================

Each line corresponds to one pair of satellite signals, and contains three
floating point numbers separated by tab characters or spaces:

- half the splitting between the satellite signals
- the intensity of the satellites as a fraction of the parent signal
- the isotope shift in ppm

Thus a satellite file for just a pair of one-bond 13C satellites with
a 1JCH of 125 Hz and a secondary isotope shift of 2 ppb would, given the
natural abundance of 13C of 1.109%, be 

62.5	0.00561	0.002

Where a single line rather than a pair of lines is required (e.g. to use as
reference a signal containing chlorine, which has different secondary isotope
shifts for 35Cl and 37Cl), just set the coupling constant to zero and halve
the required relative intensity. Thus a reference signal that has a secondary
peak of 10% of the parent peak amplitude 10 ppb away would require the line

0	0.05	0.01

When calculating the relative intensities of satellite signals, the effects of
all the isotopomers present should be include in the calculation. Thus to
generate a satellite file for the 1H signal of TMS that includes the effects of
one-bond and two-bond 13C couplings and of two-bond 29Si couplings, but not of
the 13C satellites of the 29Si satellites etc. (i.e. that ignores isotopomers
with more than one rare isotope), the original signal is split into 1.109%
one-bond 13C satellites, 3.327% two-bond 13C satellites (because the methyl
being observed is adjacent to three other methyls) and 4.67% two-bond 29Si
satellites. This leaves a parent signal of only 90.894%.

A satellite file suitable for the 1H signal of TMS could contain the following lines

59.1  0.00610  0.00155
	one-bond 13C coupling 118.2 Hz
natural abundance 1.109% gives relative intensity 1.109/(2*90.894)
      secondary isotope shift  1.55 ppb

3.31  0.0257   0.00013
	29Si two-bond satellites
	4.67% natural abundance
      secondary isotope shift  0.13 ppb

1.37  0.00229   0.0002
1.16  0.00687   0.0002
0.95  0.00687   0.0002
0.74  0.00229   0.0002
	13C two-bond satellites (quartets)
      2JCH = 2.11 Hz, 4JHH = 0.21 Hz
	secondary isotope shift  0.2 ppb
