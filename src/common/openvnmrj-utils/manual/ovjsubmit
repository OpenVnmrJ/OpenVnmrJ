License
=======
All submissions must be licensed under the Apache v2 license, which can be
read at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html
Additionally, a Contributor License Agreement must be completed prior to a
pull-request to the OpenVnmrJ repository, giving the University of Oregon 
rights to use and distribute your contributions. A copy may be read at
https://gist.github.com/ekpaulson/73530dfe735fa54d81fa

You must include a file called LICENSE in your contribution and it must
be the Apachev2 license for inclusion in the OpenVnmrJ repository.

Repositories
============
The repository by default is "appdirs" which contains a directory for each user
contributed appdir. This appdir is "openvnmrj-utils" in the appdirs repository.

Fork on GitHub
==============
If you have not done so, fork https://github.com/OpenVnmrJ/appdirs.git on GitHub. 
You will need a free GitHub account, then click on the "Fork" icon on the top right
of the repository. See https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ for more
information. If you intend to "push" changes to github, you will probably need to
use the ssh protocol. This requires using ssh-keys. Check this website for details.
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys

Branches
========
Use either the "development" branch or your own branch to submit your contribution.
If you used a branch other than development, specify it using the -b switch.

Updating
========
If an application directory with the same name already exists, this script will exit
unless the U flag is given to update the application directory.

Update the tag to indicate a new version, for example -t 1.1

Submitting
==========
Make a fork of the OpenVnmrJ repository on GitHub.com first

On your OpenVnmrJ computer:
1. Make a directory with the name of your submission. Let's call it "mysub". 
   The name must not have any spaces or special characters.
2. Make subdirectories maclib, manual, etc inside this directory mysub
3. Put your files in the appropriate folders
4. Make a file called description, with a text based description of your contribution.
5. Make a file called title with a readable name of the contribution.
6. Copy the Apache License file into the directory. It must named "LICENSE"

You will have some or all of these:
mysub----maclib--macro files
.......|-manual--manual files
.......|-psglib--pulse sequences (.c files)
.......|-parlib--parameter files for pulse sequences
.......|-bin--executables
.......|-templates--UX xml files
.......|-data--test data (FIDs)
.......|-LICENSE (Apachev2 for inclusion into OpenVnmrJ)
.......|-description (multiple lines with description of your appdir)
.......|-title (single line with a human readable name)

In this example, run the script like:
./submitcontribution -p pathto/mysub -u your-github-name

This script will clone your fork from GitHub, check your files, then add them to the repository.
Finally, the repository will be pushed back to GitHub using your credentials.

Pull request
============
When your contribution is in your fork on GitHub, make a pull request by going to 
your repository on GitHub then clicking on the green Pull Request button.

See http://openvnmrj.org for more information or help.

in the ~/vnmrsys/appdirs directory.  You will need internet access and the "git" Linux
utility must be available.

The popup window shows the current list of available appdirs. Clicking on the appdir
title will give a description of the appdir. A button next to the title will be labelled
"Install Appdir" if that appdir is not yet installed. It will be labelled "Remove Appdir"
if it has previously been installed. 

If appdirs are either installed or removed, after clicking the Close button, the 
appdirs editor will start. At this point, one can re-order the priority of the appdirs.
By default, ovjapps adds new appdirs to the bottom of the priority list. Click the OK
button to exit the appdirs editor.
