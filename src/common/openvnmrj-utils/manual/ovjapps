ovjapps - install or remove OpenVnmrJ appdirs

The macro will install or remove appdirs from OpenVnmrJ. The appdirs will be installed
in the ~/vnmrsys/appdirs directory.  You will need internet access and the "git" Linux
utility must be available.

The popup window shows the current list of available appdirs. Clicking on the appdir
title will give a description of the appdir. A button next to the title will be labelled
"Install Appdir" if that appdir is not yet installed. It will be labelled "Remove Appdir"
if it has previously been installed. 

If appdirs are either installed or removed, after clicking the Close button, the 
appdirs editor will start. At this point, one can re-order the priority of the appdirs.
By default, ovjapps adds new appdirs to the bottom of the priority list. Click the OK
button to exit the appdirs editor.
