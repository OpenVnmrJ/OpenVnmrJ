makeXdecshape

Creates WURST or CHIRP DECOUPLING Shape to Decouple C13, N15 and F19
IMPORTANT: It is assumed that the probe has been properly calibrated
IMPORTANT: Written for DD2, VNMRS and 400MR (running VJ42A) only
Usage: In OpenVnmrJ Command Input Window, type                          
   makeXdecshape(arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4)                           
   arg1=pattern (CHIRP or WURST)                                
   arg2=bandwidth in ppm                                        
   arg3=nucleus to be decoupled (C13 or N15 or F19)
   arg4=largest 1-bond JXH in Hz                                
   Example: makeXdecshape('CHIRP',200,C13,146)
