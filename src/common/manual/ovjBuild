ovjBuild  - script to build OpenVnmrJ from source code.

ovjBuild builds OpenVnmrJ from the latest sources on
github. Internet access is required. When used for the first
time, the toolchain required to build OpenVnmrJ will be installed.
This will require root or sudo access.

ovjBuild tests internet access by "pinging" www.github.com.
The ping command may fail due to a firewall blocking it.
If you are sure the system is connected to the internet
and want to bypass this "ping" test, use
   ovjBuild noPing

OpenVnmrJ will be built in an ovjbuild directory in your HOME
directory.

Note that building directly from the source code on github will
make an OpenVnmrJ with all the latest features and bug fixes.
The generated dvd images will also have an upgrade.nmr script
that can be used instead of load.nmr.  However, the OpenVnmrJ
made in this manner has not undergone a beta test. The OpenVnmrJ
on the releases page of github ( https://github.com/OpenVnmrJ/OpenVnmrJ/releases )
has undergone a beta test. The Notes.txt file in the dvd image
is the change log for OpenVnmrJ.

Using ovjBuild with the -c (or --codeonly) option will only download
the OpenVnmrJ sources from github. It will not try to compile them.
The git command is required for ovjBuild to work. It will be installed
if it is not present. The ovjBuild command should not be executed from
the root account. It will test that the HOME parameter is not "/root".
