sethw -   Set values for hardware in the acquisition system
readhw -  Read current values of acquisition hardware
*******************************************************************

The SETHW command (SET HardWare) allows the VNMR program to set values
for selected parameters in the acquisition hardware.

The READHW (READ HardWare) allows the VNMR program to read the current
values of these parameters in the acquisition hardware.

Parameters which can be accessed include the parameters of the lock
system and the shim DACs and sample location.  They are:

	lockpower, lockgain, lockphase, z0	"lock system parameters"
        z1, z2, z3, z4, z1c, z2c		"axial shim DACs"
        x1, y1, xz, yz, xy, x2y2, x3, y3	"non-axial shims"
        z5, xz2, yz2, zx2y2, zxy	"special shims for Oxford magnets"
        loc                             "sample changer location"

readhw accepts the keyword 'status' to read the system status
(e.g., Idle, Active, etc). The status is returned as an integer.
The values of the integers are:

IDLE        10
PARSE       15
PREP        16
SYNCED      17
ACQUIRE     20
PAD         25
VTWAIT      30
SPINWAIT    40
AGAIN       50
ALOCK       60
AFINDRES    61
APOWER      62
APHASE      63
SHIMMING    70
SMPCHANGE   80
RETRIEVSMP  81
LOADSMP     82
ACCESSSMP   83   AS7600 access open condition
ESTOPSMP    84   AS7600 Estop condition
MMSMP       85   AS7600 Magnet motion condition

INTERACTIVE 90
TUNING      100
INACTIVE    0

The readhw command with status as the argument may display or return
error values. These are

-1    available on spectrometer only (ie system = 'datastation')
-2    acquisition not active  (Acquisition communication programs
                               are not running. Probably needs
                               acqcomm)
-7    console powered down or not connected

readhw accepts the keyword 'temp' to return the temperature.
For example, readhw('temp'):$t sets $t to the temperature.
If additional return values are given, then the temperature controller
status and the requested temperature set point can be obtained.
The second return value is the status and the third return value
is the set point.  For example
  readhw('temp'):$t,$stat,$set
will set $t to the current temperature, $stat to the controller
status and $set to the requested temperature set point.
The controller status is returned as an integer. The values of the
integers are:

Regulation off  0
Regulated       1
Not regulated   2
No controller   3

If there is no VT controller, or the regulation is off, the temperature
set point will be returned as 3000.

readhw accepts the keyword 'spin' to return the spinning speed.
For example, readhw('spin'):$s sets $s to the spinning speed.
If additional return values are given, then the spin controller
status and the requested spin set point can be obtained.
The second return value is the status and the third return value
is the set point.  For example
  readhw('spin'):$s,$stat,$set
will set $s to the current spinning speed, $stat to the controller
status and $set to the requested spin set point.
The controller statuses are the same as those above for the 'temp'
case.

readhw with the keyword 'loc' returns the sample changer location for the
sample in the magnet. After a console reboot or an eject/insert operation,
the console does not know the current sample changer location. readhw('loc')
returns a 0 in this case. A 0 means that if a sample is in the magnet,
the console does not know its sample changer location. The command
readhw('loc'):$loc,$detected will return a second value ($detected in the
preceding example) which will be set to 0 if the console hardware does
not detect a sample in the magnet. The second return value will be set
to 1 if the console hardware detects a sample in the magnet.  Immediately
after putting a sample in the magnet with an insert command,
  readhw('loc'):$loc,$detected will set $loc=0, since it does not know the
sample changer location, and it will set $detected=1, since it detects the
sample in the magnet.

readhw with the keyword 'remainingtime' returns the time, in seconds, of the
current acquisition. If no acquisition is running, it returns a zero.

readhw with the keyword 'inqueue' returns the number of experiments in the
queue to be run. If no acquisition is running or if an acquisition is running
but there are no acquisitions queued to run when it finishes, it will return
zero. This does not count the number of experiments queued to an automation
run. It counts queued acquisitions submitted by running go / ga / au in
different workspaces.

The SETHW command accepts parameter name - value in pairs as arguments.
You must specify at least one parameter name - value.  An example:

	sethw('z1c',30,'z2c',-50)

A maximum of ten parameters can be set using this command.

Normally the SETHW command sends the new values to the acquisition console
and then verify these new values.  It then updates the corresponding VNMR
parameters.  Use the `nowait' keyword to cause SETHW to just send the new
values to the console, without verifying them or changing VNMR parameters.
The `wait' keyword is accepted to confirm the default mode of operation.

The `wait' or `nowait' keyword must either be the first or the last
argument.

The READHW command obtains the current settings for each parameter
passed to it as arguments.  An example:

	readhw('z1c','z2c','z1','z2')

This command obtains the values for the coarse and fine Z1 and Z2 shim
coils.

The settings can be stored in VNMR variables if the variables are part
of the return value list.  An example:

	readhw('z1c','z2c','z1','z2'):r1,r2,r3,r4

This command will store the current setting for the coarse Z1 shim in
`r1', the coarse Z2 shim in `r2', the fine Z1 shim in `r3' and the fine
Z2 shim in `r4'.

If no return variable is supplied, the setting will be displayed in the
status window of VNMR.

The commands READHW and SETHW cannot be used when an acquisition is in
progress or when ACQI is connected to the acquisition system.
