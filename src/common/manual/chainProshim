The chainProshim macro concatenates any number of Proshim methods into a single method.

One can simply list the methods as arguments to the macro. For example
chainProshim('touchup','pfg')
will do the touchup followed by the pfg method.
One can repeat a single method either by listing it multiple times or by following
the method name by a count. For example
chainProshim('pfg','pfg','pfg','pfg','pfg')
chainProshim('pfg',5)
chainProshim('pfg',4,'pfg')
all do five pfg methods.
chainProshim('pfg',3,'gxyz','touchup',2)
will do three pfg, one gxyz, and two touchup methods.

If you want the entire proshim to be performed in background, provide 'bg'
as the first argument to chainProshim. For example, 
chainProshim('bg','gxyz','gxyz','pfg',1,'touchup',3)
will do two gxyz, one pfg, and three touchup methods in the background.
