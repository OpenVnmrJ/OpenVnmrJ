*******************************************************************************

Non-interactive spectral addition and subtraction uses the spadd and
spsub commands.  The last displayed or selected spectrum is added to
(spadd) or subtracted from (spsub) the current contents of the
add/subtract experiment.  The spmin and spmax, instead of adding or subtracting,
take the minimum and maximum, respectively, of the two spectra.

The commands have two numeric arguments, both of which are
optional.  The first is the multiplier; the second is the shift.  Thus the
spectrum can be multiplied and/or shifted.  (To shift a spectrum without
multiplying it, use a multiplier of 1.0)  A positive shift values moves
the current spectrum to higher frequency, or to the right.  A negative shift
value moves the spectrum to lower frequency, or to the left.

The commands have an optional 'range' argument, which, in turn has optional
highfield and lowfield values.  The range option adds only the specified
range of data points to the add / subtract experiment. Points outside the
range are treated as zeros. If the highfield and lowfield arguments are not
given, they default to sp and sp+wp. That is, the currently displayed portion
of the spectrum will be combined with the add / subtract experiment.
If the range option is used, the normal limit that the Fourier numbers of the
two data sets being combined is not enforced. The shift option may be used to
position a section of a spectrum with a smaller fn value into the addsub spectrum.
If used, the multiplier and shift arguments must precede the 'range' argument
and its options highfield / lowfield arguments. If used, the shift argument is
relative to the left edge of the addsub data set. The range option works for
spadd, spsub, spmax, and spmin.

A multi-element add/subtract experiment may be created with the spadd or spsub
command.  The optional argument 'new' will create a new spectrum in the
add/subtract experiment.  For example,  the commands clradd select(1) spadd
from some experiment will create the add/subtract experiment with a single
spectrum in it.  If the next commands typed are select(2) spadd,  then a
single spectrum which is the sum of the original spectra one and two will
be made in the add/subtract experiment.  If, on the other hand,  the
commands select(2) spadd('new') were typed,  then the add/subtract experiment
will contain an array of two spectra corresponding to the original spectra
one and two, respectively.

Individual spectra in a multi-elemnet add/subtract experiment may subsequently
be added to and subtracted from.  The spadd and spsub command without a
'trace' argument will add or subtract from the first spectrum in the
add/subtract experiment.  Adding the 'trace' argument followed by a
required index number will select another spectrum to be the target of the
add/subtract.  For example, select(4) spadd('trace',6) will take the fourth
spectrum from the current experiment and add it to the sixth spectrum in the
add/subtract experiment.  When using the 'trace' argument, that spectrum must
already exist in the add/subtract experiment by using an appropriate number
of spadd('new') or spsub('new') commands.

The spadd and spsub commands support a 'newtrace' argument, which is the same
as the 'trace' argument except that the data in the selected add/sub trace
is replaced with the new data.  If 'newtrace' is used in conjunction with
the 'range' argument, only the selected range in the add/sub trace will be
replaced with the new data.  If the index provided with newtrace is 1 larger
than the number of spectra in the add/sub experiment, it is equivalent to
using the 'new' argument.

The results can be examined by joining the add/subtract experiment with the
jaddsub macro and using the normal spectral display and plotting commands.

spmin takes the minimum of two spectra, considered point-by-point in an
absolute-value sense. For example, if the two corresponding values are
-2 and +3, the spmin spectrum will have -2; if the two values are +2 and -3,
the spmin spectrum will have +2 at that point.
The function of spmin is to essentially select for common features within two
spectra while eliminating features that are not common between them. In
particular, if two CP/MAS spectra are obtained at different spin rates, the peaks
stay in the same place (and hence the spmin spectrum also contains the same
peaks), but the sidebands move. If spectrum 1 has baseline where spectrum 2
has sideband, and spectrum 2 has baseline where spectrum 1 has sideband, then
the spmin spectrum will contain only baseline in these regions, eliminating the
spinning sidebands..6101

spmax takes the maximum of two spectra, considered point-by-point in an
absolute-value sense. For example, if the two corresponding values are
-2 and +3, the spmax spectrum will have +3; if the two values are +2 and -3,
the spmax spectrum will have -3 at that point.


Examples
           spadd
           spsub(0.75)
           spadd('new')
           spadd('trace',2)            // add current data to add/sub trace 2
           spadd('newtrace',2)         // replace add/sub trace 2 with current data
           spadd('range')              // add the spectral range between sp and sp+wp
           spadd('range',cr-delta,cr)  // add the spectral range between the cursors
           spadd('newtrace',2,'range') // replace the spectral range between sp and sp+wp
