debug('c')  - turn on  command and macro tracing
debug('c2') - turn on  command and macro tracing with argument tracking

debug('c0') - turn on  command error reporting
debug('C') -  turn off command and macro tracing
***********************************************************
   debug('c') (lower case "c") will turn on Vnmr command and
   macro tracing.  A list of each command and macro will be
   printed.  Nesting of the calls is indicated by indentation
   of the output. The macro name of the calling macro and the
   line number from it was called are also displayed. If the
   command or macro is called from another command, such as
   exec, or from the command line, the calling macro and line
   number will be displayed as (null):0
   The return status of each command or macro is also indicated
   as returned or aborted.

   debug('c2') is the same as debug('c'), except arguments and
   return values of commands and macros are also displayed.

   debug('c3') is the same as debug('c2'), except parameter
   assignments are also displayed.

   The Magical debugger will display the line number of a macro
   that fails. It will not display the line number if a command
   called by a macro fails. Turning on debug('c') or debug('c2')
   or debug('c3') will tell the Magical debugger to also display
   the line numbers of a failed command called by a macro. The
   debug('c0') also causes the line number of a failed command
   to be displayed, but it does not turn on the macro tracing
   features.

   The output from debug('c') can be directed to a shelltool or
   put into a file. To direct the output to a shelltool, go to
   that shelltool and enter the command
      tty
   It will respond with something like
      /dev/pts/11
   where the number will vary. From the VnmrJ command line,
   enter the command jFunc(55,'/dev/pts/11') where the second
   argument is the result of the tty command. To direct the
   output to a file, replace the second argument of the jFunc
   command with a filename. For example, jFunc(55,userdir+'/debug')
   will send the output to the debug file in your vnmrsys directory.

   debug('C') (upper case "C") turns off the debugging output started
   with debug('c'), debug('c2'), debug('c3'), or debug('c0').
   This feature is primarily a debugging tool for Magical programming.
