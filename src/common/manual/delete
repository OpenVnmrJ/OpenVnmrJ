delete		- 	remove files and .fid or .par directories
rm		-       implementation of the UNIX rm command
*******************************************************************************

  The rm command removes one or more files from the file system. 
  It works like the Linux rm command with the exception of the -R
  option. The -R option removes the contents of the directory but not
  the directory itself. It is like the Linux command
    rm -rf directory/*
  If the -R is used, the directory name cannot contain the wildcard (*)
  and the directory must exist. Otherwise, the rm command will abort.
  By returning an argument to the calling macro, as in
     rm('-R','directory'):$dum
  the rm command will not abort.
  If only a single file name is given, it does not contain wildcards, it
  exists,  and only zero or one of the options '-f', '-rf', '-fr', or
  '-R' are given, the rm command uses fast built-in functions.

  If the first argument is 'regex' or 'regextest', then rm expects the next
  argument to be a directory name, without wildcards, and the third
  and last argument to be a "regular expression" to describe which
  files or directories should be removed. If the directory does not exist,
  the rm command will just return. Since "regular expressions" may
  be unfamiliar, the 'regextest' argument is available to just list the
  files and directories that would be removed without actually
  removing them. This is primarily a tool to be used during macro development.

  If the conditions on the arguents listed above are not met, then the
  actual /bin/rm Linux command is called, which is slower than the
  built-in functions. 

  Usage  -  rm('filename')
            rm('-rf','directory1')
            rm('-R','directory1')
	    rm('filename1','filename2')  // calls slower external /bin/rm
            rm('regex','directory1','^'+operator)  // files that begin with an operator's name
            rm('regex','directory1','\\.fid$)       // files or directories end with .fid

  In the last example,  the dot (.) must be "escaped" with the backslash or the
  "regular expression" rules would match it with any character. Also note that two
  backslashes must be used since the magical interpreter also treats the backslash
  as an escape character.


  The delete command is a safer command than rm.  It will not allow
  "wildcard" characters nor the -r option.  It will, however, delete
  .fid and .par directories.  These are the only directories which
  normally will need to be removed.  (Experiment directories may be
  removed with the delexp command.)  The delete command will also
  delete files.  This command first searches for the filename passed
  as an argument.  If it finds that file and that file is not a directory,
  it will be deleted.  If the file is not found,  a .fid is appended
  to the file name.  If that directory is found, it will be removed.
  If the .fid file does not exist, a .par is appended and that file
  will be removed if it is found. If the filename is following be a
  null string, then files with .fid or .par will not be searched for.

  Usage  -  delete('filename')
	    delete('filename1','filename2')
            delete('filea','')   // useful if you are not sure 'filea' exists
                                 // but do not want to delete filea.fid or
                                 // filea.par
