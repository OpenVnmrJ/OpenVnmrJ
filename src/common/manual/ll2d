******************************************************************************

ll2d automatically finds and integrates peaks that are above the threshold
"th" in a 2D spectrum or a 2D plane of a 3D spectrum and writes the peak
frequencies, FWHH, volume, and the boundaries of the integrated region to a
file in the "ll2d" subdirectory of the current experiment directory.  For 2D
spectra, the file name is "peaks.bin" and for 2D planes of 3D spectra, 
the file name is "peaks_f#f#_#.bin", where "f#f#" gives the plane direction
(e.g. "f1f3") and the final "#" gives the number of the plane.  ll2d also
allows for interactive insertion and deletion of peaks and for reading and
writing of text peak files for easy import and export of peak data.

The possible options are :
	NONE or  'peak'  Finds all peaks in the displayed area that are above
			a threshold "th".  If dconi is active and in BOX mode,
			then only find peaks in the area defined by the cursors.
	 'volume'	For all peaks in the displayed area, finds the bounds
			of the peak and integrates its volume.
	 'adjust'	Adjusts boundaries of all peaks in the displayed area
			so that no boundaries overlap and recalculates peak
			volumes.
	 'reset'	Deletes the peak table.
	 'read'		Reads in a binary peak file.  If a full pathname is
			not specified, the file is searched for first in
			the current working directory and then in the "ll2d"
			subdirectory of the current experiment directory.
	 'read','FILENAME'	Reads in a binary peak file named "FILENAME".
	 'readtext'	Reads in a text peak file.  If a full pathname is
			not specified, the file is searched for first in
			the current working directory and then in the "ll2d"
			subdirectory of the current experiment directory.
	 'readtext','FILENAME'	Reads in a text peak file named "FILENAME".
	 'writetext'	Write a text peak file into the ll2d subdirectory
			of the current experiment directory.
	 'writetext','FILENAME'	Writes a text peak file named "FILENAME".
	 'writepeaks'	Write the index, F1 and F2 center, and amplitude
                        of each peak into the ll2d subdirectory
			of the current experiment directory.
	 'writepeaks','FILENAME' Writes the index, F1 and F2 center, and
                        amplitude of each peak to a file named "FILENAME".
	 'pos' or 'neg' These options can be used in addition to 'peak',
			or 'clear' to operate only on positive
			or negative peaks.
	 'draw'         Draws the peaks, boxes, numbers, and labels on the
			spectrum based on the value of the
			parameter "ll2dmode".

	dconi must be active for these :
	 'mark'		If in dconi CURSOR mode, inserts a peak at the current
			cursor position.  If in dconi BOX mode, integrates the
			area within the cursors and assigns that volume to all
			peaks within the cursors which do not have their bounds
			already defined. If there are no peaks within the area
			defined by the cursors, finds the highest point within
			this area, marks that as a peak, integrates the area
			within the cursors, and assigns that volume to the peak.
	 'unmark'	If in dconi CURSOR mode, deletes the nearest peak.  If
			in dconi BOX mode, deletes all peak bounds which are
			completely within the area defined by the cursors.
			Peaks are not deleted in BOX mode. This option may
                        re-number the peaks.
	 'clear'	Deletes all peaks in the displayed region in dconi
			CURSOR mode or all peaks within the cursors in dconi
			BOX mode.
	 'label'	Prompts for a 15 character label which is assigned to
			the nearest peak in dconi CURSOR mode or to all peaks
			within the cursors in dconi BOX mode.  To erase an
			existing label, enter a label which consists of one or
			more spaces.
	 'label','LABEL'	Executes 'label' option using "LABEL"
			instead of prompting for a label.
	 'comment'	Prompts for an 80 character comment which is assigned
			to the nearest peak in dconi CURSOR mode or to all
			peaks within the cursors in dconi BOX mode.
	 'comment','COMMENT'	Executes 'comment' option using "COMMENT"
			instead of prompting for a comment.
	 'combine'      Must be in dconi BOX mode for this.  Combines all peaks
			within the area defined by the cursors into one peak
			with its center at the average of all combined peaks'
			centers, and its bounds containing the maximum extents
			of the combined peaks' bounds.  If all combined peaks
			have the same label, this label is assigned to the new
			peak.  NOTE :  All peaks which are to be combined are
			deleted prior to the creation of the new combination
			peak, and there is no automatic way to restore the
			original peaks.  Therefore, it is recommended that you
			make a backup copy of the peak file prior to using
			this command. The combine option may re-number the peaks.
	 'combinewt'    Must be in dconi BOX mode for this.  This is the same
                        as the 'combine' option except that the center is
                        the average of the amplitude weighted peaks.
	 'autocombine'  Automatically combine peaks in the region defined by sp,
                        wp, sp2, and wp2. This option reguires two additional arguments,
                        which define the width, in Hertz, for the F1 and F2 windows,
                        respectively. The process is to find the most intense peak and
                        then combine it with all other peaks within the F1 and F2 windows
                        defined by the two additional arguments. This process is repeated
                        with the next most intense peak that has not already been combined
                        with other peaks. This process is then repeated until all peaks
                        have been accounted for.
	 'autocombinewt'This is the same as the 'autocombine' option except that the
                        center is the average of the amplitude weighted peaks.
	 'info'         Prints information about the peak nearest the cursor
			to the text window.  If return values are requested,
			the printing is suppressed.  The return values are 
			(in this order) : peak number, f1, f2, amplitude,
			volume, label, comment, FWHH1, FWHH2, f1_min, f1_max,
			f2_min, f2_max.

	 dconi does not have to be active for these :

	 'label','LABEL',#	Executes 'label' option on peak # using "LABEL"
			instead of prompting for a label.
	 'comment','COMMENT',#	Executes 'comment' option on peak # using
			"COMMENT" instead of prompting for a comment.
	 'combine',#,#,...	Executes combine option on the list of peak
			numbers which follows 'combine'.  With this option
			a single return value is available from ll2d -
			the peak number of the new combination peak.
	 'info','total'	Prints the total number of peaks in the current peak
			table.  If a single return value is requested, the
			printing is suppressed, and the total number of peaks
			is returned.
	 'info',#	Prints information about peak # to the text window.
			If return values are requested, then the printing is
			suppressed.  The return values are the same as given
			above for the 'info' option.
	 'unmark',#	Deletes peak number #.

The return values are :
	 $num		When not using the 'info' or 'combine' options, ll2d
			will return a single value - the number of peaks which
			have been picked.  When using the combine option, ll2d
			returns the number of the new combination peak.
     When using the 'info' option, the return values are :
	 $num		The peak number.
	 $f1		The frequency of the peak in the f1 dimension.
	 $f2		The frequency of the peak in the f2 dimension.
	 $amp		The amplitude of the peak.
	 $vol		The volume of the peak.
	 $label		The label of the peak.
	 $comment	The comment of the peak.
	 $FWHH1		The full width at half-height of the peak in f1.
	 $FWHH2		The full width at half-height of the peak in f2.
	 $f1_min, $f1_max, $f2_min, $f2_max
			The frequencies of the bounding box for the peak.
	

When ll2d is called with the 'peakno' argument, it counts the number of
peaks. It does not save any information about the peaks. It can return
the number of peaks as in
  ll2d('peakno'):$num
If provided with a maximum number of peaks, as in
  ll2d('peakno',100):$yesno
it will set $yesno = 1 if the number of peaks is less than or equal to 100.
Otherwise, it will set $yesno = 0.

Related parameters :
    ll2dmode :  Four character string composed of the characters 'y' and 'n'.
		   The first character determines if a "+" is drawn on the
		   screen in dconi displays to mark peaks, the second controls
		   drawing of the peak number, the third controls drawing of
		   the peak bounds box, and the fourth controls drawing of the
		   peak label.

    th2d :	This parameter is used by ll2d when determining the bounds of
		   a peak and calculating its volume.  It can take a value
		   between 0.0 and 1.0.  If th2d is set to 1.0, ll2d
		   integrates all points in the peak which are above the
		   current threshold for the spectrum (that is, the portion
		   of the peak which can be seen in a contour plot of the
		   spectrum).  A smaller value of th2d will cause ll2d to
		   integrate a larger area when determining the volume of
		   a peak.  If th2d is 0.5, for example, ll2d will integrate
		   all points in a peak which are above 0.5 times the current
		   threshold.

    xdiag :	This parameter is used by ll2d to exclude diagonal peaks when
		   peak picking.  Peaks within xdiag Hertz of the diagonal
		   will not be picked by ll2d.  Setting xdiag to 0.0 will
		   cause ll2d to pick all peaks including diagonal peaks.
