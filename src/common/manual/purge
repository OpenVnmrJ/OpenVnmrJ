purge		   - 	remove all macros from memory
purge('macroname') - 	remove the macro 'macroname' from memory.
*******************************************************************************

  The macrold command loads a macro into memory. The purge('macroname')
  will remove a macro called macroname from memory.  The purge
  command with no arguments will remove all macros which have
  been loaded into memory.
  The command purge with no arguments can be called from macros but
  its action will be delayed until all macros have completed. If purge
  with no arguments is called from a background process, it is ignored.
  The command purge with an argument should never be called by the
  macro which is being purged.

  Usage  -  purge			remove all macros from memory
            purge('_sw')                remove macro _sw from memory
