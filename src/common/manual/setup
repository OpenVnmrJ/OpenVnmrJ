setup<('nucleus' <,'solvent'>)> -   Set up parameters for basic experiments
***************************************************************************

Typing setup alone displays a menu with choices of nuclei.  After
choosing one,  a choice of lock solvents is presented;  one of these
is selected.  A parameter set is now returned to do the experiment
requested,  complete with positioning of the transmitter and decoupler.

Supplying setup with arguments selects the solvent and nucleus without
using the menu system.  A nucleus can be chosen from among the nuclei for
which files are present in /vnmr/stdpar ( or in the user's stdpar directory);
these typically include H1, C13, P31, and N15.  Solvents can be chosen
from among the solvents listed in the an appdir solvents file;  these
typically include CDCl3,  C6D6,  D2O,  DMSO,  Acetone,  CD2Cl2,  and
CD3OD.  If the solvent is not supplied as an argument,  CDCl3 is presumed.

Parameters set by setup are recalled from the /vnmr/stdpar directory or
from the user's stdpar directory if the appropriate file exists there.
Any changes made to the files in these directories will be reflected in
setup.  The files /vnmr/stdpar/C13.par and /vnmr/stdpar/H1.par contain
the "default" parameters for carbon and proton survey spectra,  and hence
should be modified as desired to produce spectra under desirable conditions.
