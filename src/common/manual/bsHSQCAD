bsHSQCAD: F1 Band-Selected Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence, adiabatic version

See the J1CHTab, Sel2DTab and HSQC entries for general information.

This pulse sequence utilizes fully adiabatic 13C 180s that are designed to
time refocusing to best match the likely 1JCH coupling for a given 13C chemical
shift. Generally speaking 1JCH is smallest at low values for 13C chemical shifts and
increases in value as carbon shift increases. These specially timed adiabatic pulses
improve signal to noise, decrease loss of signal because of minor calibration defects
and generally yield data with fairly good quantification potential. Because of the
special nature of the timed sweep inversion afforded by the adiabatic pulses it is best
to retain the default value of 146 for the paramter j1xh. Cyclo-propyl groups are an
expection that will suffer from phase distortion because the 13C chemical shift is at
very high-field yet the 1JCH coupling is very large.

All adiabatic pulses are created and parameters loaded into the experiment at setup
time using the calibrations found on the probe file.

This is a F1-band-selected experiment. At setup time customize in the Acquire -> Default
panel to define the desired region either interactively with cursors if a HSQC has
been acquired as a part of the study previously or just entry the desired F1 range
into the entry boxes. There is a button to create the shape and subsequent display of
pulse sequence will reflect the true selective pulse parameters.
