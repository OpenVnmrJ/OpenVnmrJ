noise(<excess noise,<last measured noise,<block_no>>>) - 
   	measure the noise level of a fid.
averag(n1,n2,...nn)

       calculate the ernst angle	
pw/p1
       calculate the flip time

ddf,ddff,ddfp:
  Without any arguments, the file header only is displayed. With arguments,
  a block header and part of the data of that block is displayed.
    block_no is the block number, default 1
    trace_no is the trace number within the block, default 1
    first    is the first data element number within the trace, default 1
      If the numerical index first is replaced by a keyword 'max', the
      maximum absolute value data point is displayed instead.  If a return
      argument is given, the maximum value is returned, and is not displayed.  
      For FID's, the maximum value in the block is scaled by the values of
      of scale and ctcount in the block header. A second return argument will
      to be to this scaled value.
      

noise:
  If two input arguments are added, they are used  	      
    to calculate the noise figure - the first input   	    
    argument is the excess noise, the second is the  	   
    last measured mean square noise.  The 3rd argument 
    may be use to specify the block number, default 1. 
  Output to parameters:
    real/imaginary dc
    real/imaginary rms noise
    average rms noise
    channel imbalance (%)
    db noise
    noise figure (if input arguments)
       
averag(n1,n2,...nn):
  Place a series of numbers in the input parameters and produce 
	the average and	the standard deviation.
  Output to parameters:
    r1: average
    r2: standard deviation
    r3: argument count
    r4: sum
    r5: sum of squares

ernst(t1,<90degree>)
  Calculate the ernst angle pulse with a guess at t1 
 	and the 90-degree pulse calibration and sets pw.
  If there is a parameter pw90 and no second parameter is entered,
	pw90 is taken as the 90-degree pulse.  An entered 2nd
	argument resets pw90.
 
pw/p1(pwdegrees,<90degrees>)
  Calculate the flip time in microseconds given a desired 
        flip angle in degrees and the 90-degree pulse in
 	microseconds.  pw or p1 enters the value into the
 	appropriate pulse width parameter.
  If there is a parameter pw90 and no second parameter is entered,
	pw90 is taken as the 90-degree pulse.  An entered 2nd
	argument resets pw90.
