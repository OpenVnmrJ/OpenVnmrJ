dialog - Bring up a window with a message.

This is not a macro but can be called from scripts.
In its simplest form, it displays a message and provides an "OK"
button to dismiss the window. The command is

   java -jar /vnmr/java/dialog.jar "Show this mesage"

The message can be fancier by using html. For example,

   java -jar /vnmr/java/dialog.jar "<html>An incredible <em>OVJ</em> experience.<br>Availble from <u>github.</u><br> For details, see <i>www.github.com/OpenVnmrJ</i></html>"

If a second argument is passed, such as input, the dialog box will
present an entry field. Whatever value is typed into the entry box
will be passed back to the calling script when the OK button is clicked.
For example,

   java -jar /vnmr/java/dialog.jar "Enter the name of the sample" input

If the second argument is pass, the input will be hidden. For example

   java -jar /vnmr/java/dialog.jar "Please enter the root password" pass
