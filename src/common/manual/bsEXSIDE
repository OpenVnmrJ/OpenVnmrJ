bsEXSIDE - Experiment to measure long-range 1H-13C couplings as pure-phase
responses in F1.

The (HC)bsEXSIDE experiment is a double band selective version of the
EXSIDE experiment and provides a method to measure long-range H/C coupling
constants of typically a single PROTON. To drastically reduce experiment
time while keeping the required high resolution in F1 (to determine small
couplings) it is band-selective in C13 and hence the C13 sw1 bandwidth can
be reduced to enclose a single resonance only.
The coupling constants will be in phase pairs in the F1 dimension scaled
by a jscaling parameter. If the jscale factor were 15 (default) the true
coupling constant would be the F1 separation/15.
A larger jscale factor is beneficial to determine smaller couplings but
typically at the expense of signal:noise.

The following experiments can be converted into a bsEXSIDE experiment (in
manual operation or under automation):

- PROTON: The H1 selection band(s) can be selected interactively in the
  PROTON spectrum, while the C13 bandwidth must be entered in the Acquire
  -> Defaults panel manually.

- selexcit: With a selexcit 1D spectrum already present (in the current
  workspace or in an automation Study), the H1 selection will be taken
  over from that spectrum and only the C13 bandwidth must be entered.

- HMBC-type spectra (e.g. gHMBCAD): If a 2D HMBC-type spectrum is already
  present (in the current workspace or in an automation Study), the H1 and
  C13 bandwidths can both be chosen interactively in the 2D spectum using
  the two pairs of crosshair cursors.
  An option exists to choose a different F1 bandwidth (typically narrower)
  than the selection pulse band-width to keep the C13 pulses shorter.

NOTE:
When irradiating more than one H1 resonance, it must be made sure that the
selected resonances do not share a H1-H1 coupling (belong to the same spin
system). To make sure, acquire a gCOSY first and take note of which
protons are coupled to one another.
