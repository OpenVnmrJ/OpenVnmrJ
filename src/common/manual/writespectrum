writespectrum -  write a spectrum to a binary file 
readspectrum  -  read a spectrum from a binary file 
****************************************************************************

writespectrum will write out the current spectrum as a binary file.
The file has no header information and will be written in the native
format (little-endian on Linux; big-endian on Solaris).

writespectrum will write whatever would be displayed by ds or dcon. That is,
is looks whether ph, av, or pwr mode is selected.  It looks at ai versus
nm mode.  It scales the data by vs. It writes the file in the
current experiment as specN, where N is the element number. A
macro like

wft
$i=0
while ($i < arraydim) do
  $i = $i + 1
  select($i)
  writespectrum
endwhile

will write files spec1, spec2, spec3 ... spec{arraydim} in
the current experiment directory.  If the first argument is a path name,
it will be used rather than the default spec1, spec2, etc. in the current
experiment directory.

If the first argument is the pathname, additional optional arguments
may be supplied.
If a real number follows the path name, it will be used as a scaling
factor to override the normal scaling based on vs and ai or nm mode.
An optional keyword 'all' will cause all elements to be written to a
single binary output file. This can be used to write out a complete
2D data set.  For 2D data, the argument 'f1' will cause each f1 trace
to be written consecutively. The argument 'f2' will cause each f2 trace
to be written consecutively.  The default is 'f2'.
An optional keyword 'int' will cause the spectra to be written as
integer data. The default is to write the data as floating point data.
The keyword 'float' can also be used. It just selects the default.

The following macro illustrates how to write the real and imaginary
components if phase mode is selected.

wft
ph
$i=0
$index=''
while ($i < arraydim) do
  $i = $i + 1
  format($i,0,0):$index
  select($i)
  writespectrum
  mv(curexp+'/spec'+$index, curexp+'/spec'+$index+'.re') 
  rp = rp + 90
  writespectrum
  mv(curexp+'/spec'+$index, curexp+'/spec'+$index+'.im') 
  rp = rp - 90
endwhile

The Bruker "r" (1D) and "rr" (2D) file formats may be created with the
writespectrum command. These binary files are typically integer files.
A convenient scaling factor for converting the OpenVnmrJ floating point
numbers to integer values is 1048576.0, which is the hexadecimal
value 0x100000.  The 2D "rr" files are "f2" style.
The command for 1D data would be
  writespectrum('<path>/pdata/1/1r',1048576.0,'int')
The command for 2D data would be
  writespectrum('<path>/pdata/1/2rr',1048576.0,'int','all','f2')
  



readspectrum will read a spectrum from a binary file into the current
experiment. For 1D data, one can read in "real-only" data or complex
data. For "real-only" data or 2D data, the first argument is the path name of
the binary file, as in:
   readspectrum(userdir+'/realData') 
To read in complex 1D data, the first argument is the keyword 'complex'
and this is followed by the path name of the binary file containing the
"real" data following by the path name of the binary file containing the
"imaginary" data, as in:
   readspectrum('complex',userdir+'/realData',userdir+'/imagData') 
The 'complex' option is not available for 2D data.

Following the path name, an optional real number will be used as a scaling
factor.
The optional 'float' keyword specifies the data in the binary file
are floating point numbers. The optional 'int' keyword specifies the data
in the binary file are integer numbers. The default is 'int'.
The optional 'nods' keyword will suppress display of the spectrum after
it is read into the experiment.
If a 2D data file is being read, the readspectrum needs to know the dimensions
of the 2D matrix. The 'incr' keyword, followed by the number of f1 increments
defines the number of elements in the indirect dimension. The number of
elements in the direct dimension (fn) will be calculated based on the size
of the binary file and the supplied value of 'incr'. For 2D data, the argument
'f1' will cause readspectrum to interpret the binary file as if each f1 trace
had been written consecutively. The argument 'f2' will cause readspectrum
to interpret the binary file as if each f2 trace to be written consecutively.
The default is 'f2'.

The Bruker "r" (1D) and "rr" (2D) file formats may be imported with the
readspectrum command. These binary files are typically integer files.
A convenient scaling factor for converting the integer values to the
OpenVnmrJ floating point value is 1.0/1048576.0, which is the hexadecimal
value 1.0/0x100000.  The 2D "rr" files are "f2" style.
The command for 1D data would be
  readspectrum('<path>/pdata/1/1r',1.0/1048576.0,'int')
The command for 2D data would be
  readspectrum('<path>/pdata/1/2rr',1.0/1048576.0,'int','incr',<FTSIZE>,'f2')
where FTSIZE is the value from Bruker's "proc2s" file.

Note: The current implementation of readspectrum imports data into a single
OpenVnmrJ data block. The current data block maximum size for 2D data will
support an "rr" file that is 1k x 8k. Theat would correspond to OpenVnmrJ
values of fn=16k and fn1=2k. If larger data sets are being used, set the
Linux environmental variable memsize to 512 or larger, as in
  setenv memsize 512
prior to starting OpenVnmrJ.  The readspectrum command will read any size data.
If the memsize is too small, when you try to display the data with dconi, you
will get the message
  "2D blocksize too large for local configuration.  Reprocess on current host."
