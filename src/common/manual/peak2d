*******************************************************************************

  "peak2d" searches the area defined by "sp","wp","sp1" and "wp1" in a
2D data set for a maximum. It returns the maximum intensity found in the
first return variable. If a second return variable is defined, it returns
the trace number in that variable. The variable "trace" defines, whether
"f1" or "f2" traces are counted. If a third return variable is defined,
it returns the data point number of the maximum on that trace.

The second form of the peak2d commands takes four arguments defining the
area within which to search for the maximum. It returns the maximum intensity
in the first return value. The maximum is scaled by the vs2d parameter. It may
be either a positive or negative maximum. The second and third return
arguments contain the F2 and F1 frequencies of the maximum point.

In both cases, if a fourth return argument is specified, it returns a measure
of the noise in the 2D data set. It does this by first measuring the average and
the standard deviation of all the points in the 2D matrix. It then measures the aveage
and standard deviation of the ponts in the 2D matrix that are smaller than the
absolute value of the previous average plus three times the standard deviation.
The returned value is the absolute value of the new average plus three times
the standard deviation times vs2d.  (abs(average) + 3.0*stddev) * vs2d

Examples

peak2d(sp,sp+wp,sp1,sp1+wp1):$max,cr,cr1

finds the maximum in the currently display region and sets the cursors to that
position.

peak2d(cr-delta,cr,cr1-delta1,cr1):$max,$f2frq,$f1frq

finds the maximum in the region enclosed by the cursors
