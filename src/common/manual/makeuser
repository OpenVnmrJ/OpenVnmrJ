makeuser	Add a new Vnmr user account or update an
                existing Vnmr user account                 (U)
**************************************************************

 The makeuser command is provided to create a new user account
 with permission to access the VNMR files and programs.  The
 makeuser command will also install the necessary files and
 directories into the user's home directory.

 The makeuser command can be run by the system administrator's root
 account or by any current user with appropriate permissions.  In
 order to add a new user to the system,  makeuser must be run by
 root.

 When root executes makeuser,  the location of the VNMR system
 directory,  if not available from the vnmrsystem environmental
 parameter, will be requested.  The most likely location, which is
 provided as the default, is /vnmr.  When executed as root,  the user
 name whose account is to be added or updated may be supplied as an
 argument to makeuser.  If no name is supplied,  one is requested.
 The makeuser script checks to see if the user is already defined
 in the system.  If not,  the /etc/passwd file will be updated with
 the new user and the user will be added to the nmr group in the
 /etc/group file.  A home directory will also by made.  The location
 of the home directory is encoded in the makeuser script and may be
 altered if desired.  By convention,  on Linux systems,  the home
 directory is made in the /home directory.  Also by convention,
 on MacOS systems,  the home directory is in the /Users directory.
 Note that the makeuser script updates the /etc/passwd and /etc/group
 files on the local machine.

 The above operations require root privileges to execute.  After
 finishing these tasks,  the makeuser script gives root an opportunity
 to exit from the script.  

 A user other than root can run the makeuser script.  In this case,
 the makeuser script will only update the current user's files.
 If one tries to update another account,  an error will be reported.
 If a user runs the makeuser script (or the root account decided not
 to exit when given the above opportunity),  the following question
 will appear
      Automatically configure user <username> account (y or n) 
 where username is replaced by the user's name.  If this is answered with
 a y,  then the necessary UNIX files and Vnmr files will be added to the
 account and various Vnmr subdirectories will be made.
 After logging out and then logging in, whenever vnmrj is typed, OpenVnmrJ
 will start.  If the above question is answered with an n, meaning one
 does not want all the files automatically updated,  then two additional
 questions are asked.
      Automatically configure UNIX environment (.files) (y or n)
      Automatically configure Vnmr directories and global parameters (y or n)
 Answering n to one or both of these questions invokes an interactive mode
 where one is asked
      OK to update Unix_file (y or n)
 for the various UNIX dotfiles (for example,  .login, .profile, .vnmrenvsh, etc).
 For the Vnmr related files and subdirectories,  one is asked
      Create subdirectory of your VNMR user directory (y or n) 
      Update your VNMR global parameters (y or n) 
 The actual UNIX dotfiles which are used for the automatic update are stored in
 this user_templates directory.  The Vnmr global file is also stored there.
