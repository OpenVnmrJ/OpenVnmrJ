****************************************************************************

The makefid command lets you introduce computed data into your experiment.
The input files contains numeric values, 2 per line.  The first value is
assigned to the X (or real) channel; the second value on the line is
assigned to the Y (or imaginary) channel.

The first argument, which is required, is the name of the file containing
input.  Arguments specifying the element number and the format are optional
and may be entered in either order.

The element number is any integer greater than or equal to 0.  If 0 is passed,
the existing FID file is deleted and element 1 will be added. If the element
number is greater than 0, then that element will be added.  If that element
already exists in your FID file, the program will overwrite the old data
unless the optional 'add' argument is given as the last argument to makefid.
If the 'add' argument is given, the FID will be added to the existing data.
If the 'rev' argument is given, the imaginary channel of the FID will negated,
thereby reversing the frequency axis of the spectrum.
If element number is not entered, the default is 1.
If the element number is larger than the existing number of elements,
a new element is added at the specified element number. If the specified
element number is greater the 1 more than the existing number of elements,
the intervening elements will be zero filled.  Whenever a new element is created,
the 'add' option can be given or not. 

The format argument lets you select between single precision integer, double
precision integer, or floating point data in the resulting FID file.
Use one of the following character strings to specify the format:

	'dp=n'			single precision (16-bit) data
	'dp=y'			double precision (32-bit) data
	'16-bit'		single precision (16-bit) data
	'32-bit'		double precision (32-bit) data
	'float'		        floating point   (32-bit) data

The number of points comes from the number of numeric values read from the
file.  makefid reads only 2 values per line.

If the current experiment already contains a FID, you will not be able to
change either the format or the number of points from that present in the
FID file.  As noted above, you can use an index of zero to delete the
existing FID file.

Be aware that makefid does not look at parameter values when establishing
the format of the data or the number of points in an element.  Thus if the
FID file is not present it is possible for makefid to write a FID file
with a header that does not match the value of dp or np.  Since the
active value is in the processed tree, you will need to use the setvalue
command if any changes are needed.

If the target FID is a link to another file, which happens if the data are
returned to an experiment with the rt command, the links will be removed so
that the previously linked FID file is not modified.

An alternative form of makefid will calculate an FID based on the frequency,
amplitude, decay rate, and phase of a spectral line. The first argument,
which is required, is the name of the file containing input.  Arguments
specifying the element number and the keyword 'calc' and may be entered
in either order. The 'calc' keyword is not optional. The element number
is optional. The default is element 1. With the 'calc' option, the data
format will be the same as any pre-existing data. If no pre-existing data
exists, either because the fid file was removed or because a 0 was supplied
as the element number, the data format will be float.

As above, using an element number of 0 will delete the current
FID file before adding element 1. If the element number is larger than
the existing number of elements, a new element is added at the specified
element number. If the specified element number is greater the 1 more
than the existing number of elements, the intervening elements will be
zero filled. An optional 'add' or 'sub' as the last argument will
add the FID to the existing FID as opposed to replacing it.  Whenever a
new element is created, the 'add' option can be given or not. The 'sub'
argument is the same as 'add' except the phase of the line is inverted
by adding 180 deg.

Examples include:

makefid(curexp+'/fidlines','calc')
makefid(curexp+'/fidlines','calc',1)
makefid(curexp+'/fidlines','calc',1,'add')
makefid(curexp+'/fidlines','calc',1,'sub')
makefid(curexp+'/fidlines',1,'calc')

The input file specifies the frequency, amplitude, decay rate and phase.
All four numbers must be on a single line. Multiple lines may be in the
file. Lines starting with a # are comments. Blank lines are ignored.
An example file is:

# Freq   Amp   Decay Phase
  2500.0 10.0  0.1   0.0
  0.0    20.0  0.1   0.0

The current values of the sw and np parameters are used to determine 
the dwell time and the number of points to calculate.  The frequencies
range between -sw/2 and sw/2. A 0.0 frequency will give a peak in the
middle of the spectrum.

makefid can be called with
the keyword 'calcstr' and the  frequency, amplitude, decay rate and phase
of that line can be passed as the second argument. The second argument must
be a string of space separated list of the parameters. The optional element
number can also be passed as the third argument. The default is element 1.
With the 'calcstr' option, the data format will be the same as any
pre-existing data. If no pre-existing data exists, either because the fid
file was removed or because a 0 was supplied as the element number, the
data format will be float.

The behavior of the element number, 'add' and 'sub' arguments is the same
as for the 'calc' case.
Examples include:

makefid('calcstr','2500.0 10.0 0.1 0.0',0)  // Delete existing FID first
makefid('calcstr','2500.0 10.0 0.1 0.0',2)  // Add a second FID
makefid('calcstr','2500.0 10.0 0.1 0.0',4)  // Add a fourth FID, the third FID is added as zeros.
makefid('calcstr','2000.0 20.0 0.1 0.0',2,'add')  // Add another component to the second FID


writefid
--------
The writefid command writes a text file using data from the selected FID
element.  The default element number is 1.  The program writes 2 values
per line.  The first is the value from the X (or real) channel; the second
is the value from the Y (or imaginary) channel.
