setref -   Set Frequency Referencing Based on Lock Signal Shift (M)
*******************************************************************************

      Syntax: setref
              setref<(nucleus)><:r1<,r2<,r3<,r4>>>>


 Description: "setref" assumes the sample is locked. It extracts the 2H
	      chemical shift from an appdir "solvents" file, calculates the (auxiliary)
	      2H reference frequency (TMS-d1) from the lock frequency (lockf =
	      lockfreq + lkof/1e6) as follows:
        		H2_TMSfreq = lockf / (1 + solppm/1e6)
	      then takes the Xi values for 2H and "tn" and calculates the
	      auxiliary reference frequency ("reffrq") for the observe nucleus
	      at the given field strength:
        		reffrq = H2_TMSfreq / Xi(H2) * Xi(tn)
	      from this, "rfl" and "rfp" are set:
        		rfp=0
        		rfl = sw/2 - (sfrq - reffrq)*1e6
	      You can NOT say you have referenced your sample to TMS after
	      calling "setref", but you have simply ESTIMATED the reference
	      frequency based on an estimated chemical shift value for the
	      lock signal. Note that the chemical shifts for many lock
	      solvents (such as D2O, CDCl3) are subject to changes by
	      temperature, pH (pD), sample interaction, etc., and in the case
	      of external locking, bulk susceptibility effects may also affect
	      the accuracy of the result.
	      "setref" reports its referencing action on line 3; if you want
	      to suppress that feedback (e.g., when calling "setref" in
	      macros), you can simply add a return argument.
              If a global (or local) flag "bioref" exists and is set to 'y',
              bio-NMR referencing (based on "nuctables/nuctabrefBio") is used
              rather than standard IUPAC / organic chemistry referencing
              (based on "nuctables/nuctabref").

	      "setref" is also a utility macro that is called by other macros.
	      It returns four numeric values:
		- the calculated value of "rfl"
		- the calculated value of "rfp"
		- the calculated value of "reffrq"
		- the calculated value of "refpos"
	      If used with return arguments, output on line3 is suppressed.
	      If used with a nucleus name as argument, e.g.,
			setref(tn):$rfl,$rfp,$reffrq,$refpos
	      or
	      		setref('C13'):$rfl,$rfp,$reffrq,$refpos
	      "setref" does NOT set any referencing parameter, but ONLY
	      returns the calculated values, assuming "sw=0.0 offset=0.0"
	      (where "offset" is equivalent to "tof", "dof", etc.).

    Examples: setref
	      setref:r1
	      setref:$rfl,$rfp,$reffrq,$refpos
	      setref(tn):$rfl,$rfp,$reffrq,$refpos
	      setref('C13'):$rfl,$rfp,$reffrq,$refpos
