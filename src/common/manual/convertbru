convertbru filename <options>     -  from UNIX shell
convertbru('filename'<,options>)  -  from Vnmr

	This is a C program for converting 32-bit Bruker AMX FID data,
	24- and 32-bit Bruker AM FID data, and floating-point Bruker NEO
   data into a 32-bit format compatible with Varian's Sread program.
   For AMX and NEO data, the filename given
	to convertbru should be the name of the directory which contains
	the acqus, acqu2s, and fid or ser files.  For AM data the filename
	given to convertbru should be the file containing the AM data.
	The input file is not required to have a '.bru' extension, but if it
	does, the '.bru' extension is stripped before creating the output
	file.  The output file is called 'filename.cv' and will be written
	in the current working directory unless the "-c" option is present.

   The sread program can only handle integer data. The NEO floating
   point data will be converted to integer in the sdata file. A new
   -a option is added to output an ascii file of the data. This file
   can be used by makefid to read in the floating point numbers.

	For AMX data and AM data containing the "-1" (parameter) sector,
	the following options will usually NOT be necessary, but can be
	used to override the convertbru program's default actions.

	Options :
	    -bxxx	xxx = am or amx.  Specifies whether data is AM or
			AMX data. (default : determined from filename given)
	    -cfilename	append ".cv" to "filename" and use it as the output
			filename.
	    -dxxx	xxx = decoupler frequency (must be a value
			between 10.0 and 640.0 MHz).
			(default : read from data set)
	    -f		Specifies that old output file is to be overwritten.
			(default : don't overwrite old files)
	    -oxxx	xxx = lsb, msb.  Specifies whether the data has 
			least- or most-significant bit first.
			(default : For AM data, determined from data set.
				   For AMX data, default is lsb.)
	    -pxxx	xxx = number of 24- or 32-bit words to skip before
			converting data.  (For use with "-tdata" option to
			skip the header in AM data without converting it).
			Typical header sizes are 216 or 256 words.
			(default : 0)
	    -sxxx	xxx = 3 or 4.  Specifies whether data is 24-bit (3-byte)
			or 32-bit (4-byte) AM data.  (AMX data is 32-bit.)
			(default : determined from data set.)
	    -txxx	xxx = all, hdr, or data.  Specifies whether convertbru
			should convert both the header and the data, just the
			header, or just the data.
			(default : all)

	Examples of use for AM data :

	UNIX Shell :
	  convertbru filename		"determines file format and converts
					 header and data in filename.bru"
	  convertbru filename -d250.0
					"determines file format and converts
					 header and data in filename.bru.  Sets
					 decoupler frequency to 250.0 MHz.
	  convertbru filename -thdr	"determines file format and converts
					 only the header in filename.bru"
	  convertbru filename -tdata -p256 -s3 -omsb
					"converts only the data in filename.bru
					 after skipping the 256-word header.
					 The data is converted assuming it is
					 24-bit AM data words with the most-
					 significant bit first."

	Vnmr :
	  convertbru('filename','-tdata','-p256','-s3','-omsb')
					"converts only the data in filename.bru
					 after skipping the 256-word header.
					 The data is converted assuming it is
					 24-bit AM data words with the most-
					 significant bit first."

	Examples of use for AMX data :

	UNIX Shell :
	  convertbru filename -f	"Converts acqus and acqu2s files
					 to ASCII, if necessary.  Then
					 converts data and overwrites an
					 existing filename.cv file"

	Vnmr :
	  convertbru('filename','-f')	"Converts acqus and acqu2s files
					 to ASCII, if necessary.  Then
					 converts data and overwrites an
					 existing filename.cv file"
	  convertbru('filename','-c/home/vnmr1/brukerdata/data1')
					"Converts acqus and acqu2s files
					 to ASCII, if necessary.  Then
					 converts data and writes it to
					 the file :
					 "/home/vnmr1/brukerdata/data1.cv".

	The order of the options in both formats (UNIX shell and Vnmr)
	is arbitrary.  However, the filename must be the first argument in
	both cases.

	After converting the Bruker data into the new format, the converted
	data can be read into Vnmr using the command :

	     sread('filename.cv', <'parameter template name'>)

	from within Vnmr.  The name of the file containing the param-
	eter template is optional; the default is bruker.par.  If no
	parameter template is specified and bruker.par cannot be
	found in either the user or system parlib directory, sread
	will abort with an appropriate error message.

   For NEO data, the three step process would be:
	     convertbru('filename','-a')
	     sread('filename.cv', <'parameter template name'>)
        makefid('filename.cv/sdataxy',0,'float')
        

	The data can then be processed normally.  The parameters "proc"
	and "proc1" are set appropriately by sread, so that wft or wft2da
	will correctly process the data.

	Bruker parameters are converted to Varian parameters as
	described below.

	AM Parameter Conversion :

	   Bruker Parameter	  Varian Parameter
		num sweeps completed	ct
		td			np
		dw			dw
		fw			fb=fw/2.5
		ds			ss
		sw			sw
		num experiments done	ni
		o1			tof
		o2			dof
		rd (or d1 if rd==0)	rd
		pw (of p0 if pw==0)	pw
		de			de
		ns			nt
		sp			satdly
		dp			dpwr
		te			temp=te-273
		id			dw1
		id			sw1=1/id
		sfo1			sfrq=sfo1+o1
		sfo2			dfrq=sfo2+o2
		p#			p#
		d#			d#
		s#			s#
		ro			spin
		date			date
		time			time

	The above Bruker parameters which are named and which don't conflict
		with a Varian parameter name are also converted under the
		original name : td,fw,ds,o1,o2,ns,te,id,sfo1,sfo2,ro.
	The parameters proc and proc1 are set to rft for all spectra.  (This
		assumes that data is TPPI in both dimensions).


	AMX and NEO Parameter Conversion :
	   Bruker Parameter	  Varian Parameter

		ns (from acqu)		nt
		ns (from acqus)		ct
		td			np
		td (from acqu2s)	ni
		sw_h			sw
		sw_h			dw=1/sw*1.0e6
		sw_h (from acqu2s)	sw1
		sw_h (from acqu2s)	dw1=1/sw_h
		fw			fb=*sw/2.5
		ds			ss
		rd (or d1 if rd==0)	rd
		de			de
		pw (or p0 if pw==0)	pw
		p1			pw90
		te			temp=te-273
		sfo1			sfrq=sfo1
		sfo2			dfrq=sfo2
		o1			tof
		o2			dof
		ro			spin
		date			date
		date			time
		nucleus (or NUC1)	tn
		decnuc  (or NUC2) dn
		pulprog			pslabel
		pulprog			seqfil


	These and all other Bruker parameters are converted under their
		original names, if it doesn't conflict with the name of a
		Varian parameter.  Arrayed Bruker parameters like P and D are
		converted to the names P# and D# where # is the index into the
		array.  Because of the limitation of 8 character parameter
		names in sread, the parameters routwd1# and routwd2# are
		converted to rtwd1# and rtwd2#.  The parameter proc is set to
		ft when the Bruker parameter aq_mod is 1 and set to rft when
		aq_mod is 2.  proc1 is always set to rft, assuming TPPI in t1.
		If there is a file named 'info' in the directory with the
		Bruker data, it is read in and put into the text file for the
		converted data set.
