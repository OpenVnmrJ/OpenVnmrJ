svf<(file<,'nolog'><,'arch'><,'force'><,'replace'><,'nodb'>)>  - Save Fid
******************************************************************************
  
Saves parameters, text, log,  and FID data in the current experiment to a file. No data
is removed from the current experiment; svf merely saves a copy of the data
in a different file. You can enter rt to retrieve the complete data set, or enter
rtp to retrieve parameters only.

file is the name of the file, with the suffix .fid added, to be created to save
the data. The default is the system prompts for a file name. You are warned if
you attempt to overwrite a file that already exists. In fact, if data has been
acquired with the file parameter set, the data does not need to be saved. It is
already stored in a named file.  If a filename is given and a file already exists
with that name, you will be asked to confirm your choice.  If the 'force' option
is given, then an existing .fid directory will be removed.
If the 'replace' option is given, only the files that are normally saved
by the svf command will be replaced. Any other files that may be in the
.fid directory will be left alone.

'nolog' is a keyword to not save the log file with the data. The default is to
save the log file.

'arch' is a keyword to assume that the data goes to a database and appends
to the (or creates a) doneQ file with information that can be used by the
command status.

'nodb' is a keyword to prevent the svf command from adding information to a
database.  This is useful if temporary fid files are saved that will soon be removed.
