svdfit - linear equations fitting procedure

Given a set of linear equations, svdfit wil find the
least squares solution.  A specific example could be

  100*x1 +  33*x2 +   0*x3 = 133
    0*x1 + 133*x2 + 100*x3 = 133
  100*x1 + 200*x2 + 200*x3 = 300
    0*x1 + 133*x2 + 100*x3 = 133
  100*x1 +  33*x2 +   0*x3 = 133

In matrix form, this may be expressed as
  [A] * [x] = [b]
where [A] is the nrow (5) by ncol (3) matrix of the
linear equation coefficients
  100  33   0
    0 133 100
  100 200 200
    0 133 100
  100  33   0

[b] is the observation vector of nrow elements. In this
example, it is
  133 133 300 133 133

[x] is the solution vector of ncol elements calculated to be
  0.1
  0.5
  1.0

svdfit uses singular value decomposition to solve the set of linear
equations.  The svdfit command is called with three arguments.

svdfit(apath, bpath, xpath):$chisq

apath is the filename of a text file containing the nrow x ncol matrix
of coefficients. The number of rows (nrow) must be greater than or equal
to the number of columns (ncol)

bpath is the filename of a text file containing a single line containing
the nrow experimental values.

xpath is the filename of a text file which will contain the ncol solution vector
It will be written with one value per line.

If a return argument is given, as in $chisq in the example above, the chi-squared
value will be returned as a goodness-of-fit value.  If will be the sum of the
squares of the difference between the calulated values ([A]*[x]) and the experimental
values ([b])
  chisq = sum of (([A]*[x] - [b]) * ([A]*[x] - [b]))
