   When writing to device 'graphics' in the 'xor' mode, if one or more
   characters are positioned over the same previously drawn characters,
   the characters will be erased.

   When writing to device 'graphics' or device 'plotter',  the write
   command will return the height of the characters if a return argument
   is provided.  This is useful for positioning multi-line displays.
   For example

     write('graphics',100,100,''):$ys

   sets $ys to the height of a character.  See the macro dtext for an
   example of usage.

   When writing to device 'graphics' or device 'plotter',  the write command
   will accept a color argument.  The nine standard color names (red, green, etc)
   listed above may be used. In addition, the eight symbolic color names (cursor,
   integral, etc) may also be used. The actual colors associated with the symbolic
   names may be set with the "Display options..." tool in the Edit menu. The advantage
   of using the symbolic names is that they are probably adjusted to look good with
   the chosen background color. For example, using the color white for writing on the
   graphics screen may look fine with a dark background, but will be invisible if
   the background is white.  Using the color 'parameter' will probably look good
   for both light and dark backgrounds. The default color is 'parameter'.

   When writing to device line3, write will display the output on the 
   information output line. Optionally, if a return value is requested,
   the output will be returned to the calling macro and will not be displayed
   on line3.  For example,
     write('line3','The value of pw is %g us',pw):n1
   will not display on the line3 device but will set the parameter n1 to
     'The value of pw is 8.2 us'
   Writing to 'line3' will also display the message in the message box in the hardware
   toolbar at the bottom of the VnmrJ interface. Writing to the 'error' device is the
   same as writing to 'line3', except the message in the hardware toolbar message box
   will be displayed in red, and, if enabled, a beep will sound.
   If the output starts with "Warning: ", then writing to 'line3' with this output will
   strip the "Warning: " from the output and display the rest of the output in yellow
   in the toolbar message box. Note that a space is required after the colon.

   When writing to a file using the keyword 'file',  each write command
   automatically appends a carriage return (linefeed) to the end of the
   string defined by the template argument.  If the keyword 'fileline'
   is used instead of 'file',  then the carriage return is not automatically
   appended.  When using 'fileline',  any carriage returns should be explicitly
   defined by the template argument.  Also, with the 'file' keyword, two
   backslashes (\\) are interpreted as a carriage return.  With the
   'fileline' keyword, two backslashes will output a single backslash
   into the file.

   When using the 'reset' option, the write command will create an empty file
   by the name of filename, the second argument. If the 'filename' file already
   exists, write('reset',<filename>) will clear the file.

   For the character conversion (%c), you can supply either a single character
   or a decimal number representing the character in the ascii character set.
   Note that this is different from the printf convention where the number
   is supplied as octal.  If a decimal number is supplied, it must be entered
   as a string with a leading backslash (\).  An example to write out all
   ascii characters is

   $i=1
   $s=''
   while ($i < 128) do
     format($i,0,0):$s
     write('file',userdir+'/chars','%3d <%c>', $i, '\\'+$s)
     $i = $i + 1
   endwhile

   When writing to a network program using the keyword 'net', the host name and
   port number must be supplied.  The host name may also be an IP address, such
   as 10.190.x.y.  The hostname of your local computer is stored in the "instrument"
   parameter.  The command serverport may be used to get the port number for the
   currently executing VnmrJ program.  One could then use the write('net',... command
   to send a message to yourself, over the network.  An example for doing this is

   serverport:$port
   write('net',instrument,$port,'banner(`hello`)\n')

   Note that a carriage return (\n) is required after the command.
