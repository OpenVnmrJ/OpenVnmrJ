dc	- 	calculate spectral drift correction
cdc	-	cancel drift correction
*******************************************************************************

  "dc" calculates a linear baseline correction. The beginning and
  end of the straight line to be used for baseline correction are
  determined from the display parameters "sp" and "wp". The "dc" command
  applies this correction to the spectrum and stores the definition
  of the straight line in the parameters "lvl" (level) and "tlt" (tilt).
  A small number of points at each end of the region are averaged and
  used to determine lvl and tlt parameters.  If dc is called with an integer
  argument, eg. dc(1), than that number of points will be averaged at each
  end of the region and used to determine the lvl and tlt parameters.

  cdc resets the parameters "lvl" and "tlt" to zero.
