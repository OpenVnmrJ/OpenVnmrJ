fixuser	Fix potential problems with an OpenVnmrJ account (U)
**************************************************************

 The fixuser script is provided as a convenience script to fix
 potential problems with an OpenVnmrJ user account. 

 If a pulse sequence fails to start, this could be due to an old
 version still residing in ~/vnmrsys/seqlib. The fixuser script
 will ask if these old sequences should be removed.

 Another possibility is the pulse sequence is linked to an old
 version of libpsglib, which is created if someone runs the
 psggen command. The fixuser script will ask if the files
 generated by a previous psggen should be removed.

 While rare, sometimes the java interface for OpenVnmrJ fails
 to open. This sometimes is due to corrupted files in the
 ~/vnmrsys/persistence directory. The fixuser script will ask
 if the most likely culprits should be backed up. If it still
 fails to open, one can try the following from a terminal:
    cd ~/vnmrsys
    mv persistence persistence.bad
