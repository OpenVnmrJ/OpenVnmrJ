*******************************************************************************

The exec command allows an arbitrary VNMR command or macro to be executed.  It
lets a macro construct a character string which is a VNMR command or macro and
then execute that command or macro.

Some macros and commands abort. This causes the calling macro to also abort.
By using exec with a return value, whether or not the called macro aborted
or not is returned as a macro variable. The calling macro is not aborted.
For example, in the simple macro

macroB
write('line3','got to here')

if macroB aborts, the write command is not executed and the calling macro
aborts.

If a return argument is given to exec, it will be set to 0 if the called
macro aborts and it will be set to 1 if the called macro does not abort.
For example, in the following macro

exec('macroB'):$ret
if ($ret = 0) then
  write('line3','macroB aborted')
else
  write('line3','macroB did not abort')
endif

one or the other write commands will execute, depending on whether macroB
aborts. The calling macro does not abort, but continues executing its
instructions.

The ABORTON and ABORTOFF mechanism can also control whether or not the
calling macro aborts if its called macro (macroB in the above examples)
aborts. However, continued execution of the called macro is not
guaranteed. For example,

ABORTOFF
macroB
ABORTON
write('line3','got to here')

will often execute the write command, whether or not macroB aborts.
However, if macroB calls ABORTON and subsequently aborts, or if
macroB calls another macro that calls ABORTON, and one of those macros
aborts, then the calling macro will abort before the write command
is executed. Using the exec command with a return argument, as in
exec('macro'):$ret , guarantees that execution of the calling macro
will continue.

The execexp command is like exec except that it will execute the command
or macro in another experiment, specified by the first argument. The command

execexp(4,'macroB'):$ret

is like
  jexp:$curexp
  jexp(4)
  exec('macroB'):$ret
  jexp($curexp)



  Usage:    exec($cmdstr):$ret  - execute the contents of $cmdstr
                                  as a VNMR command 

            execexp(exp#,$cmdstr):$ret - execute the contents of $cmdstr
                                           as a VNMR command in exp "exp#"
