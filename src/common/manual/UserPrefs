The UserPrefs macro constructs a popup window that allows one to set operator default values.
It is generally not run manually. If one selects the Edit->Perferences... menu item,
a popup appears with one of the tabs labelled "UserPrefs". If one then selects that tab,
there is a button labelled "Setup default values". That button calls the UserPrefs macro.
The UserPrefs popup provides entry boxes in order to set the values. 

In order to limit the choices to those provided by a menu, one must construct a text file with
menu labels and choices. The name of the file must be up<parametername>list and it must reside
in the ~/vnmrsys/persistence/cpADMIN directory. The format for the file is the same as for all
menu files.  It is two values per line, each value enclosed in double quotes. The first value
is what is presented in the menu, the second value is what the parameter is actually set to. 

As an example, to provide the choices for researchgroup as a menu, the file up<parametername>list
would be ~/vnmrsys/persistence/cpADMIN/upresearchgrouplist. A sample file might contain:

"Group 1" "Group_1"
"PI someone" "someone"

The menu would show two choices: "Group 1" and "PI someone". Selecting one would set
researchgroup='Group_1' or researchgroup='someone', respectively.
