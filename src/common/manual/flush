flush	- Write out data in VNMR memory to disk and parameters.
flush('noPars')   - Write out data in VNMR memory to disk but no parameters.
flush('noGlobal') - Write out data in VNMR memory to disk but not globals
flush2	- Remove data in VNMR memory without writing it to disk
*************************************************************************

The VNMR program keeps current data and parameters in memory buffers.
Normally, this inofrmation is not written to disk until one exits VNMR
or joins another experiment.

Use the flush command to write out this information.  One application is if
you want to access the experimental data from a program separate from
the VNMR program. In addition to writing the data, flush also write the
experiment parameters (curpar and procpar) and the global parameters.
flush('noPars') will write the data but none of the parameters.
flush('noGlobal') will write the data and the experiment parameters
(curpar and procpar) but not the global parameters.

The flush2 command removes the memory copy of data but does not write it to
disk. This command is useful when one is going to replace the disk data
with new data. For example, by using makefid. It does not write out any
parameters.
