peak<(highfield,lowfield,<'pos'|'neg'>)>:ht,frq,amp    -Find the maximum point
maxpeak<(highfield,lowfield,<'pos'|'neg'><,first><,last>)>:ht,frq,amp - Find the
                             maximum point of traces of arrayed 1D spectra.
peakmin<(highfield,lowfield)>:ht,frq,amp               - Find the minimum point
*******************************************************************************

  peak finds the height and frequency of the maximum point in the specified region.
  peakmin finds the height and frequency of the minimum absolute value point in
  the specified region, that is, the point closest to zero.
  maxpeak finds the height and frequency of the maximum point in the
  specified region among one or more array elements.

  peak and maxpeak may take an optional 'pos' or 'neg' argument. If one of these is
  supplied, it must be preceded by the highfield and lowfield arguments.
  Without one of these arguments, peak and maxpeak finds the point with the
  maximum absolute value. If the 'pos' argument is supplied, peak and maxpeak find
  the point with the largest positive value. If the 'neg' argument is supplied,
  peak and maxpeak find the point with the largest absolute value of a negative value.

  maxpeak will select a specified range of traces. Following the optional 'pos' or
  'neg' argument, maxpeak will accept an optional first trace index and last trace
  index. If no first or last arguments are given, all traces will be used.

  For both peak, peakmin, and maxpeak, height is measured in mm, and frequency is
  measured in Hz, including any referencing (i.e. the same
  frequency that you would measure by placing a cursor on that point).
  Default parameters for highfield and lowfield are "sp" and "sp+wp",
  respectively.

  The value of the height and frequency of the point
  can be returned to the caller if the command is suffixed with
  a colon and parameter names. An unscaled amplitude may be returned
  as the third value. This unscaled amplitude is independent of the
  current value of vs and whether the spectrum is in absolute intensity
  or normalized mode (ai or nm).
