    These macros are used to process data obtained using 
    an array of values for the parameter 'd2' for a T1/T1rho experiment,
    or the parameter, 'bt', base time, for a T2 experiment. 
    They run expfit which does an exponential curve fitting 
    that determines the value of T1, T2 or T1rho.

    The output is matched to the equation

    	I = (A1 - A3) * EXP(-T/TAU) + A3.

    The analysis is done by the macro 't1s/t1rs' or by 't2s' if a
    short output table is desired.
    
    The required input is the file 'fp.out' from 'fp' and the values of
    the arrayed parameter.

    The T1/T2/T1rho analysis is done for all the peaks listed in the
    'fp.out'.  Peaks are selected for analysis by typing
		fp(index1,index2,...)
    prior to running the analysis.

    The output table is the file 'analyze.list' in the current experiment.
    The file 'analyze.out' is used by 'expl' to display the results.
    
    The following steps may be used in processing a T1 or T2 experiment: 
    	1. Type: wft dssh
    	2. Type: full ds(arraydim) aph
    	3. Click Next on the menu, then Thresh; use left mouse
    	   button to set threshold
    	4. Type: dll fp
    	5  Type 't1/t1r', 't1s/t1rs', 't2', or 't2s'
    	6. If desired, adjust 'sc', 'wc', 'sc2', and 'wc2' by 
    	   typing 'center' or 'full'
    	7. Type: expl
