**************************************************************

wtfile (or wtfile1) is set to the name of the file containing
the user-written weighting function, hereafter referred to as
"wtfile" (or "wtfile1").  The macro/shellscript wtgen is used
to compile the user-written weighting function into an executable
program.  The source file is stored in the directory $vnmruser/wtlib
and has a ".c" file extension; the executable file, also in
$vnmruser/wtlib, has the same name as the source file but has no
file extension.

If the parameter wtfile (or wtfile1) does not exist, it can be
created with the following commands in Vnmr:

		create('wtfile','flag')
		setgroup('wtfile','processing')
		setlimit('wtfile',15,0,0)


If wtfile = '' (the NULL string), Vnmr does not look for a user-
written weighting function, i.e., wtfile is inactive.  User-written
weighting functions are enabled by setting wtfile = 'filename' where
filename is the name of the executable weighting function.  The
executable function has been created by compiling the weighting
function source code with the UNIX shellscript wtgen.

If wtfile is set to the special keyword wtfile='noCtScaling' then each
FID is not divided by the number of transients (ct) summed during the
acquisition of the FID data.


Vnmr first checks to see if the file "wtfile" (or "wtfile1") exists
in $vnmruser/wtlib.  If the file exists in that directory, Vnmr
then checks to see if the file "wtfile".wtp, which may contain
the values for up to 10 internal weighting parameters, exists in
the current experiment directory.  If "wtfile".wtp does not exist
in the current experiment directory, the 10 internal weighting param-
eters are set to 1.  Vnmr executes the "wtfile" program, using the
optional file "wtfile".wtp as the source for parameter input, which
subsequently creates the binary file "wtfile".wtf in the current
experiment directory.  This binary file contains the weighting vector
that will be read in by Vnmr.  The total weighting vector used by
Vnmr is a vector-vector product of this external weighting vector
and the internal Vnmr weighting vector, the latter being calculated
from the parameters LB(1), GF(1), GFS(1), SB(1), SBS(1), and AWC(1).
The parameter AWC(1) still provides an overall additive contribution
to the total weighting vector.  Although one cannot modify the
external weighting vector with WTI, one can modify the total weighting
vector with WTI by modifying the internal Vnmr weighting vector.


If the executable program "wtfile" does not exist in $vnmruser/wtlib,
Vnmr looks for a text file in the current experiment directory with
the name "wtfile".  This file contains the actual values for the
external weighting function in floating point format (e.g., 0.025, but
not 2.5e-2) with one value per line.


All user-written weighting functions must follow a prescribed format,
in analogy to pulse sequence programming.  This format is described
below:


	#include "weight.h"

	wtcalc(wtpntr, npoints, delta_t)
	int	npoints;
	float	*wtpntr,
		delta_t;
	{
	   /* user-written part */
	}


The variable wtpntr is a pointer and must be dealt with differently
than an ordinary variable, e.g., delta_t.  wtpntr contains the address
in memory of the first element of the user-calculated weighting
vector; *wtpntr is the value of that first element.  "*wtpntr++ = x"
implies that *wtpntr is set equal to x and the pointer wtpntr is then
incrementd 4 bytes (4 bytes/float variable) to the address of the
second element of the weighting vector.


EXAMPLES
--------


1.  Source file "wtfile".c in $vnmruser/wtlib:

	#include "weight.h"

	wtcalc(wtpntr, npoints, delta_t)
	int	npoints;	/* number of complex data points	*/
	float	*wtpntr,	/* pointer to weighting vector 		*/
		delta_t;	/* dwell time				*/
	{
   	   int	i;

   	   for (i = 0; i < npoints; i++)
      	      *wtpntr++ = (float) (exp(-(delta_t*i*wtconst[0])));
	}

	/* wtconst[0] to wtconst[9] are the 10 internal weighting
	   parameters which have default values of 1.  These
	   parameters are of type "float". */




2.  Optional parameter file "wtfile".wtp in the current experiment directory:

	 0.35		-  this is the value placed in wtconst[0]
	-2.4		-  this is the value placed in wtconst[1], etc.




3.  Text file "wtfile" in the current experiment directory:


	 0.9879		-  value of the FIRST weighting vector element
	 0.8876		-  value of the SECOND weighting vector element
	-0.2109		-  value of the THIRD weighting vector element
	 0.4567		-  value of the FOURTH weighting vector element
	   .
	   .
	   .
	 0.1234		-  value of the LAST weighting vector element
