fread	- 	read in variables from a file and load them in a tree
*******************************************************************************

  This command reads in vnmr variables from a file and loads them into
  a tree.  The variable trees are 'current', 'global', 'processed',
  'systemglobal', and 'usertree'.  It can read from any file that has
  variables stored in the correct vnmr format.  The default tree is 'current'.
  NOTE: if variables are read into the 'global' tree, certain parameters
  will not be loaded.  These are important system parameters that should
  not be changed.  These parameters are: userdir, systemdir, curexp, autodir,
  auto, operator, vnmraddr, and acqaddr.  If a tree is provided, it must
  be the second argument.

  A "reset" option causes the variable tree to first be cleared before
  the new variable file is read. Without this option, variables read from
  a file are added to the existing preloaded variables.  In order to
  use the 'reset' option, the tree must also be specified.

  A "value" option causes only the values of the variables in the file to
  be loaded.  If a preloaded variable does not already exist, a new one
  is not created.  Parameter attributes are not changed. Enumerated
  values are not changed. In order to use the 'value' option, the tree
  must also be specified.

  A "newonly" option causes only those variables in the file which do not
  already exist in the tree to be loaded. In order to use the 'newonly'
  option, the tree must also be specified.
  The 'reset', 'newonly', and 'value' options are mutually exclusive.

  A group type option causes only those variables in the file of that group
  to be loaded. The available group types are 'all', 'sample', 'acquisition',
  'processing', and 'display'. The group type may be used in conjunction with
  one of the 'reset', 'newonly', or 'value' options. In order to use the
  group type option, the tree must also be specified.

  The 'usertree' is available for use. By default, it has no parameters
  stored in it. It would typically be used by a macro for temporary
  parameter storage.  All of the parameter utility commands, such as
  setlimit, setprotect, setvalue, getvalue, fsave, etc. will work with
  'usertree' as the optional tree argument.  A special incantation of
  fread with a empty string as the filename will clear parameters from
  'usertree'. That is, fread('','usertree') clears 'usertree'.
  Note that passing an empty string as the filename with other parameter
  trees generates an error. For example, fread('','current') is an error.
  As with all the parameter utility commands, the other arguments also
  work with 'usertree'.  In the case of fread, this means that the
  'reset', 'value', and 'newonly' options are valid for 'usertree'.
 
  Usage -- fread(filename[,tree[,'reset', 'value', 'newonly', <group> ]])
              filename is a valid file with proper variable format.
              tree can be  current,global,processed, systemglobal,
              or usertree.
              'reset', 'value', 'newonly', and <group>  keywords can
              only be used if tree is specified.
              Available <group> values are 'all', 'sample', 'acquisition',
              'processing', and 'display'.
               

  Examples:

    fread('var1')                read in variables from file var1 into
				 current tree.
    fread('sampvar','global')    read in variables from file sampvar into
			         global tree.
    fread(curexp+'/somepars','usertree','reset') read variables from file
                                 into usertree, after first clearing the usertree.
    fread(curexp+'/disppars','usertree','display','value') read only the values
                                 of all "display" type variables into the usertree.
    fread(curexp+'/disppars','usertree','newonly','processing') read all the
                                 "processing" type variables into the usertree that
                                 do not already exist in usertree..
