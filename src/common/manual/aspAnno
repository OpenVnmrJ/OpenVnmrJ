aspAnno('save'<,path>) - save annotations to a file. If path is not provided, 
	annotations will be saved as curexp+'/datdir/annos'
aspAnno('load'<,path>) - load annotations from a file. If path is not provided, 
	curexp+'/datdir/annos' will be loaded.
aspAnno('clear') - clear annotations list and display.
aspAnno('delete'<,id>) delete a selected annotation 
aspAnno('get'):$num - get with no other arguments returns the number of annotations.
aspAnno('get',$id,$propertyName):$propertyValue - get the value of an annotation property
aspAnno('set',$id,$propertyName,$propertyValue) - set the value of an annotation property
        multiple property values may be specified in a single call to aspAnno, as in
           aspAnno('set',$id, Name1,Value1, Name2,Value2, ...)
        If the value of $id is 0, the annotation values are updated for all annotations.
        If the value of $id is a space separated list of annotation ids, as in '1 3 6 10', 
        the annotation values are updated only for those ids.
        From a macro, a local $variable can be arrayed with the ids to be updated and
        then the name of the $var can be passed as the $id, as in
           $anno=1,3,6,10
           aspAnno('set','$anno', Name1,Value1, Name2,Value2, ...)
        Note that the name $anno is enclosed in single quotes.
	valid propertyNames are 
	'type' - type of annotation, only to 'get'
	'label' - label of the annotation
	'lineColor',
	'lineThickness',
	'fontColor',
	'fontSize',
	'fontName',
	'fontStyle' - may be bold, italic, bold+italic, or plain
	'vert' - 1/0 to display label vertically/horizontally
	'roundBox' - 1/0 to show box with round or straight corners 
	'mm' - 1/0 to fix annotation to mm position or ppm position
           For lines, mm set to 2 uses mm for vertical positions
           and ppm for horizontal positions. This is useful for
           a cursor-style annotation
           For Point, Line, and Arrow annotations, mm can set set to 3
           which pins the annotation to a specific trace. In these cases,
           the 'y' value is the trace number.
	'fill' - 1/0 to fill/not fill box or polygon
	'transparency' - 0 to 100 from total opaque to total transparency 
	'arrows' - 1 or 2 to have one or two arrow heads
	'amp' - amplitude or intensity of a peak (Point)
	'vol' - volume of a peak (Point).
	'showRoi',
	'showLabel',
	'showLink',
	'x' - center x coordinate in ppm or mm
	'y' - center y coordinate in ppm(or intensity) or mm
              or trace number for point, line, or arrow annotions
              pinned to a trace (mm=3)
	'w' - total width in ppm or mm
	'h' - total height in ppm(or intensity)  or mm
	'xN' - x coordinate of point N, in ppm or mm
	'yN' - y coordinate of point N, in ppm or mm or trace number if the
               point, line, or arrow annotation is pinned to a trace.
               For example, use 'y2' to set the second point of a line or
               arrow annotation.

aspAnno('is',propertyName,propertyValue):$num,$ids - returns the number of
        annotations with the specified propertyName and propertyValue. For example
        aspAnno('is','type','BOX'):$num,$ids
        sets $num to the number of BOX annotations and sets the string $ids to a
        list of those annotations. The substr command can be used to get the
        individual ids from the $ids string.
aspAnno('is',propertyName,propertyValue,propertyName2,propertyValue2):$num,$ids 
        returns the number of annotations with both the specified propertyNames
        and propertyValues. For example
        aspAnno('is','type','BOX','lineColor','green'):$num,$ids
        sets $num to the number of BOX annotations that are also green and sets
        the string $ids to a list of those annotations. The substr command can
        be used to get the individual ids from the $ids string.
aspAnno('reset') - reset annotation properties to default defined by Display Options.
aspAnno('copy',id) - copy annotation specified by id to clipboard.
aspAnno('paste',x,y) - paste annotation from clipboard to x,y pixel position
aspAnno('paste',annoStr) - create annotation defined by annoStr
aspAnno('paste',x,y,annoStr) - create annotation defined by annoStr, 
				and move it to x,y mm position. 
	annoStr is a string similar to a line in annotation file. 
	But only fields before "label" are required. 
	see "Annotation File Format" for details.

aspAnno:$e,$n - return $e=1/0 if annotations are/not displayed, $n for number of annotations.

**********************************************************************************

1. Create Annotations

Buttons for creating annotations are located on the Graphics Toolbar.  They are available for "ds", "dss", and "dconi" display modes.

Each button corresponds to a creation mode in which left mouse clicking and dragging will create an annotation of a given type.

 Point - a point at x,y position and a label
 Text - one-line text
 Line - straight line
 Arrow - line with arrow at one or both ends
 X-Bar - horizontal bar with a label showing the width
 Y-Bar - vertical bar with a label showing the height
 Box - rectangular box with round or straight corners
 Oval - circle defined by two points
 Polygon - N point polygon that can be filled.
 Polyline - N point polyline

In creation mode, releasing the mouse button without holding CTRL key will automatically exit creation mode. Holding CTRL key enables the creation of multiple annotations of the same type.

To create a Polygon or Polyline of N points, click N-1 points on the canvas with left mouse button, add the last point (and end creation mode) with right mouse click (or left mouse click while holding CTRL key).

The position of an annotation object is defined by frequencies (in PPM). Optionally an annotation may also be defined by chart position (in mm). See "Edit Annotations" for details.

2. Select and Modify Annotations

Annotation can be moved or resized in "select" mode . This button is located on the graphics toolbar.

In select mode, hovering over an annotation will highlight the object. Drag the object will move it to a new position.

If the mouse is near a "handle" of the object, the handle will be highlighted. Dragging the handle will resize the object.

To add a point to a polygon or polyline, select the line where a point will be added and double click it when holding CTRL key.

To delete a point from a polygon or polyline, select and CTRL/double click the point.

3. Right Mouse Menus

In select mode, right mouse clicking an annotation will show a pull down menu. This menu has the following options:
	Properties...
	Delete annotation
	Delete all annotations
	Copy

In select mode, right mouse clicking an empty space will show a pull down menu. This menu has the following options:
	Save Annotations...
	Load Annotations...
	Print...
	Annotations on top
	Spectrum on top
	Paste

4. Edit Annotation Properties

The default colors, fonts, line thickness of annotation objects are defined by Annotation page of the "Display Options" dialog.

The properties of an individual object can be edited by "Property Editor", by right mouse clicking the object in "select" mode. This will allow individual objects to override the properties defined by "Display Options".

The property editor of a Point, showing as an example, allows the changes of properties for the label and the point. In addition to the color, font and line thickness, the editor has options to show/hide the label, point or the linker between label and point.

The label of a Point (or other annotation types) may contain a keyword between two %%. Valid keywords are %val%, %ppm%, %hz%, %amp%, %vol%. The keyword will be substituted by appropriate value. 

The label may also contain vnmr parameters between $$. The parameter type can be real or string.

The transparency of an annotation object is defined by a number ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 being totally opaque and 100 being totally transparent.

The editor also provides an option to fix the annotation at current chart position instead of associating it with a frequency position.

The properties of an annotation can be reset to default by the "Reset Properties" button.

Similar property editors are provided for other annotation types.

5. Delete Annotations

One or all annotations can be deleted by right mouse clicking an annotation in "select" mode.

6. Show/Hide Annotations

A toggle button on the graphics toolbar will hide or show annotations. Hidden annotations are saved in curexp+'/datdir/annos'.

7. Save/Load Annotations

Annotations can be saved to a file and loaded back with modal dialogs from right mouse menu. The directory and file name can be specified by the users. By default the directory is $HOME/vnmrsys/Annotations, and the file is annoNN.txt, where NN are auto-generated numbers.

8. Print

Annotated Spectrum can be printed using right mouse menu. A preview will be displayed in Adobe Reader and can be printed from the File menu.

9. Annotation File Format

Annotations can be saved in files. An example file is below.

The first line is a comment describing who created the file and when.
The next line gives the number of annotations that follow. In this example, 10.
The format of each annotation line is:

index type <coordinates> |<label>| labelX labelY display mm vert lineThickness lineColor fontSize fontColor fontName fontStyle transparency <additional fields>

index is the index of the annotation, from 1 to "number_of_annos".
type is the type of annotation.
The <coordinates> depend on the type of annotation. Coordinates for POINT and TEXT are a single XY pair.
LINE, ARROW, BOX, OVAL, XBAR, and YBAR require two XY pairs. The number of XY pairs to define POLYGON
and POLYLINE depends on the number of vertices.
The |<label>| is described above. labelX and labelY are not used.
display is an integer that specifies which component of a multi-component annotation to display.
For example, a POINT has the point, a label, and a link between the point and label.
display is the sum of the integers flagging whether to display that component.
  The integers are:
     showRoi    =  256 ( 0x100 )
     showLabel  =  512 ( 0x200 )
     showLink   = 1024 ( 0x400 )
To show both the roi and label, display would be set to 768 (256+512) ( 0x100 | 0x200 )
The remaining fields correspond to those described above.

Some annotations have additional fields following the transparency field.

A POINT has the amp and vol fields. amp is Y axis of 1D display, i.e., intensity of 1D data. 
   amp = (mmPosition-vp)/vs
An ARROW has an arrows field following transparency.
A BOX has roundBox and fill fields following transparency.
An OVAL and POLYGON have a fill field following transparency.
