*******************************************************************************
dconi<('options')>	- interactive 2D display
*******************************************************************************

  Allows one to display 2D traces and projections interactively.
  The displayed traces and projections may also be plotted.
  The left and right mouse buttons can be used to move cursors, the center
  button to adjust the vertical scale of traces, projections and contour
  maps, as well as to adjust the threshold in the color bar.
  The cursors may be used to select regions for expansions of the display.
  The cursors may also be used to select positions to "mark" using either
  the mark command or the ll2d('mark') command.  Either mark operation
  displays and records spectral frequencies,  maxima, intensities, and / or
  volumes.  The ll2d('mark') command, however, is recommended, as it also
  allows for interactive display and editing of mark locations.

  When dconi is invoked,  it draws the 2D data.  The default display
  mode is the color map drawn by dcon.  Dconi accepts optional arguments
  to override this default display mode.  The available options are:
     dconi('dcon')
     dconi('dpcon')
     dconi('ds2d')
  Two other special keywords are also available.  dconi('again') causes
  dconi to identify which display mode is currently being used and redraw
  the screen in that mode.  This option is useful when writing Vnmr menus.
  The other keyword is restart.  dconi('restart') will activate dconi
  without redrawing the 2D data set.  This option will cause dconi to make
  sure that 2D data is already displayed.

  Several other options are available to allow the use of user-programmable
  menus with dconi.  These are :
     'toggle'	- toggles between CURSOR and BOX mode
     'trace'	- draws trace above spectrum
     'expand'	- toggles between expand and full views of the spectrum
     'plot'     - plots projection or trace
     'hproj_max'- does horizontal projection of maximum trace
     'hproj_sum'- does horizontal projection of sum of all traces
     'vproj_max'- does vertical projection of maximum trace
     'vproj_sum'- does vertical projection of sum of all traces

  dconi can be made to execute Magical commands whenever a trace is
  selected or when view of the data changes due to a call to expand or
  full.  The actions are selected with the keywords traceMacro and expandMacro.
  The keyword is followed by the command.  For example,
  dconi('traceMacro',`write('line3','cr1=%g',cr1)`)
  will write the value of cr1 (the cursor frequency) on line 3 whenever
  a new trace is selected.  The call
  dconi('expandMacro',`write('line3','sp=%g wp=%g',sp,wp)`)
  will cause the range of the displayed spectrum to be displayed on line 3
  whenever the expand or full function is called. The expandMacro and
  traceMacro keywords cannot be used with any other keywords in a single
  call to dconi.  In order to set both functions, you will need two
  calls to dconi.  Also, calling dconi without any arguments will clear
  the trace and expand macros.  The usage would most likely be

  dconi('traceMacro',`write('line3','cr1=%g',cr1)`)
  dconi('expandMacro',`write('line3','sp=%g wp=%g',sp,wp)`)
  dconi('restart')

  The parameter vpt (vertical position trace) can be used to adjust
  the position of a trace or projection above the 2D box. The macro
  par2D will create the vpt parameter.
