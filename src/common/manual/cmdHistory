cmdHistory - keep a command history

    cmdHistory<:$global,$local>   - display or return current history files
    cmdHistory('on')              - start new global command history file
    cmdHistory('append')          - append to existing global history file
    cmdHistory('off')             - stop the global history file
    cmdHistory('on',filename)     - start new local command history file
    cmdHistory('append',filename) - append to existing local history file
    cmdHistory('off',filename)    - stop the local history file
    cmdHistory('skip')            - do not put current macro into command history

    cmdHistory will save commands executed from the command line or as a result
    using interface items such as buttons or menus.  Two separate command histories
    can be kept: a global file and a local file.  Typically, the global file would
    keep the complete history. The global file name is userdir+'/cmdHistory'.
    The local file might be used to capture inputs to build a macro or to capture
    interactions involved in a specific operation. The name of the local file is
    passed as an argument.

    A macro can avoid being added to the history files by calling cmdHistory
    with the 'skip' argument. The cmdHistory files are not kept for any background
    operations.
