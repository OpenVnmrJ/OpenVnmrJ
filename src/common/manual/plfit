plfit	  Automated deconvolution plot.

Format:	  plfit

	  Plot on a single page a real spectrum, the simulated
	  spectrum, and each of the individual components.  Label each
	  of these.  Plot in addition the numerical results of the
	  deconvolution analysis.

      To plot to a file, set the parameter
         printout='file'
      The name of the file is controlled by the plotfile parameter.
      It can be set to an absolute path name. If it is not an absolute
      pathname, the directory where the plot file will be saved is
      controlled by the "file" parameter.  If file='exp' and the studyQ
      saved the FID, it will be saved in the StudyQ .fid directory. If
      file<>'exp', and there is write permission to the directory the
      file parameter is set to, it will be saved there. Otherwise, it
      will be saved in the ~/vnmrsys/plot directory.

      The format of the saved plot is controlled by the plotfileformat
      parameter. It can be set to 'ps', 'pdf', 'jpg', 'png', 'pcl', or 'hpgl'.
      For the latter two cases, the plotter parameter must be set to a 'pcl'
      or 'hpgl' style plotter, respectively. For the first four cases, the
      plotter must be set to a postscript style plotter or it can be set to
      plotter=''
