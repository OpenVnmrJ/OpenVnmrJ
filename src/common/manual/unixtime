unixtime('format','string'):$sec - Return arbitrary time as elapsed seconds since 1970
unixtime('format',seconds):$str  - Convert arbitrary elapsed seconds since 1970 to a formatted time

systemtime('format',seconds):$str  - Convert arbitrary elapsed seconds since 1970 to a formatted time
*******************************************************************************

unixtime and systemtime are two names for the same function. Everything
described for unixtime also applies to the systemtime command. They determine
the current date and time as a system-dependent integer. The return value
is in seconds. This value is usually defined as the elapsed time from an
"epoch", which is often 1970. A second return value will give a microsecond
value, for higher resolution.

The unixtime command helps time the execution of commands.  It returns a
marker representing the current time, in seconds.  Call unixtime at the
start and the end of a sequence of operation and then subtract the starting
from the ending time to get the elapsed time.

unixtime accesses only the wall clock time, not the CPU time or any other
statistic connected with the current process.  The units for values returned
are seconds and values should be accurate to within a few milliseconds.

Be aware that unixtime cannot time operations that run in background, for
example, the ft3d command or go and its aliases.

The following Magical code fragment illustrates how you time something:


    $t1 = 0
    $t2 = 0
    $t3 = 0
    unixtime:$t1
    ft2d
    unixtime:$t2
    $t3=$t2-$t1
    write('line3','elapsed time for ft2d is %f secs',$t3

For more information, consult the UNIX manual entries time and gettimeofday.

If a single argument is provided, it is used to format the current time as a text
string. Various conversion characters can be used to format the time.
For example
  unixtime('%F %T'):$time
returns $time= '2011-01-12 15:29:55'
Some of the common conversions are
  %a   abbreviated weekday name
  %b   abbreviated month name
  %m   month as an integer (01 - 12)
  %d   day of the month (01 - 31)
  %y   year as two digit number
  %Y   year as four digit number
  %F   Same as %Y-%m-%d
  %H   hour (00 - 23)
  %M   minute (00 - 59)
  %S   second (00 - 61)
  %T   Same as %H:%M:%S
For a complete list of the format options, consult the UNIX manual entry strftime.

If two arguments are given, the behavior of unixtime depends on whether the second
argument is a number or a formatted time string. In both cases, the first argument
is a format string as for the case above. If the second argument is a number, then
unixtime uses its value as the elapsed time since 1970 to format a string  based
on the first format argument. for example, using the examples above
  unixtime('%T',$t1):$str
would set $str to the hr:min:sec just before the ft2d program was called.
If the second argument is a formatted string, then unixtime will return the elapsed
seconds since 1970. For example,
  unixtime('%a %b %d %T %Y:','Tue Dec 14 16:13:01 2010:'):$sec
will set $sec to the elapsed seconds from 1970 to the data and time of the second argument.
Note the the format conversion specification of the first argument must match the
formatted second argument. If it does not match, or if there is not enough information
to determine the number of seconds since 1970, a -1 is returned.
