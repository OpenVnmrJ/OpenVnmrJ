nextexp - command to identify the next available experiment

The nextexp command looks for files in userdir (~/vnmrsys)
named expN, where N can range from 1 to 9999. The number
and name of the first one that does not exist is returned.
The nextexp will also skip an experiment number that matches
the addsubexp value. if that parameter does not exist, the
addsub experiment is assumed to be exp5.

For example, assume exp1 - exp5 exist, 
nextexp:$num,$name
would set $num=6 and $name='exp6'
