saxis - make parameters to support axis='S'

The special value of 'S' for axis allows one to specify the range and label of an axis.
It uses the parameters fn_left, fn_right, and fn_label to define the
directly detected dimension. It uses the parameters fn1_left, fn1_right, and
fn1_label to define the first indirectly detected dimension. The values of fn_left and
fn_right can be positive or negative. It does not matter which is larger.
The macro saxis will creates these parameters and adds 'S' as a possible enumerated
value for axis.
