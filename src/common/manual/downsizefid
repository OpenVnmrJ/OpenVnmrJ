******************************************************************************
downsizefid<(factor,<datapath<,fp>>)> - downsize or truncate fid by a factor 
downsizefid<(np,<datapath<,fp>>)> - downsize or truncate fid to new np value
******************************************************************************
  
"factor" is a number greater than 0 and smaller than 1.0.
For example, downsizefid(0.5) will truncate the second half of a fid, as if it was 
acquired with half of the acquisition time (np=np/2, at=at/2). 
The default factor is 0.5.

Alternatively, one can supply the new value of np for the downsized FID. The new
value of np must be less than the current np for the FID data set.

An optional second argument specifies the filename of an FID file.
If there is no second argument, downsizefid will truncate the FID
in the current experiment.

If no second argument is given, the "current" and "processed" values
of "np" and "at" parameters will be updated.

If no second argument is given, this command will overwrite acqfil/fid
and acqfil/procpar in curexp.  If acqfil/fid is linked to a saved fid file,
the link will be replaced by a copy, so the original fid will not be overwritten.
 
An optional third argument specifies the new start of the downsized FID as an
offset into the current FID. Like the downsize factor, it can be specified
as a fraction of the total length of the FID or as the number of points
to skip. The default is 0. If you want to use the third argument and downsize
the FID in the current experiment, the second argument must be supplied as a
null string. For example, let's say the current FID has np=1024
   downsizefid(0.5,'',0.25)
will generate a new FID with np=512 and the first point of the new FID
corresponds to point 256 of the original FID.

If the fid file has multiple traces, all traces will be truncated.

This command can be repeated to further truncate the fid.
