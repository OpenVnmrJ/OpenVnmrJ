aspRoi('add') - add a ROI defined by two cursors.
aspRoi('add',ppm1,ppm2) - add a ROI band defined by two chemical shifts.
aspRoi('add',ppm1,ppm2,ppm3,ppm4) - add a ROI box defined by four chemical shifts.
aspRoi('add',ppm1,ppm2,....,'setColor',color,'setOpaque',opaque,'setHeight',height) 
	- add one or more ROI bands and set color, opaque, height for these rois.
aspRoi('autoadjust','on'/'off') - turn on/off auto adjust Roi when a new Roi is created.
aspRoi('autoadjust') - auto adjust displayed Rois to remove overlap.
aspRoi('autodefine'<,ppm1,ppm2>) -auto define ROIS between two cursors or two ppm values.
		Rois below noise*noiseMultiply (default 3) are purged.
		if noiseMultiply=0, threshold (th) will be used to purge Rois.
		Default Roi size is defined by aspPref[4]
		minimum Roi size is defined by aspPref[5]
		noiseMultiply is defined by aspPref[6]
aspRoi('delete') - delete ROIs celected by one or tow cursors.
aspRoi('clear') - delete all ROIs 
aspRoi('setColor', colorName) - set ROI color. See below for valid color names 
aspRoi('setOpaque', ) - set opaque of ROI area (0-100 from transparent to total opaque)
aspRoi('setHeight', ) - set height of ROI for 1D spectra (0-100% of plot box height).
******************************************************************************

ROIs can be loaded from a file, or created interactively in ROI "create" mode.
aspSetState(3) command sets "band" mode to create 1D ROIs. 
aspSetState(5) sets "box" mode to create 2D ROIs.
To creating multiple ROIs, drag mouse cursor while holding ctrl key.
Unique rois in "band" mode are defined by their two chemical shifts and height.
Unique rois in "box" mode are defined by their four chemical shifts.

Release mouse without ctrl key will exit create mode.

ROIs can be modified in "select" mode.
aspSetState(1) enters select mode. In select mode, mouse over a ROI will highlight the ROI.
If mouse is near a vertical border line of the ROI, the line will be selected to resize.
If mouse is inside, the ROI will be selected to move.

For 2D ROIs, horizontal border lines, or corners can also be selected to resize.
Holding ctrl or shift key will disable selecting border or corner (i.e., disable resize).

In select mode, ROIs can be deleted by right mouse click or drag over ROIs.

ROIs can be saved to a file and retrieved to any spectrum. 
ROIs are defined in ppm in the following format (for example):

# Created by hel on Fri Jul 12 13:36:49 2013 at machine fv-box1.
# in PPM
# rank name... freq... label color opaque height
1 H1    3.822   3.152   Roi 2 30 60
1 H1    2.985   2.482   Roi 2 30 60
1 H1    2.296   1.812   Roi 2 30 60
1 H1    1.347   0.863   Roi 2 30 60
1 H1    6.270   5.227   Roi 2 30 60

1st column defines the rank of ROI, which can be 1 or 2 for 1D or 2D ROIs.
2nd column is nucleus name
3rd, 4th columns are frequencies. 
5th column is label, which is not used currently.
6-9th columns define color, opaque, height of the ROIs. These columns are optional. If missing or value is set to -1, they will be defined globally by aspPref parameter. 

If aspPref[1]=-1, ROI color is defined by "Display Options" (on Graphics->DisplayColors page).
If aspPref[1]>=0, the value is color ID. The following maps a color ID to a color name:
0	black
1	red
2	yellow
3	green
4	cyan
5	blue
6	magenta
7	white
56	orange
63	pink
64	gray

Opaque is defined by aspPref[2]=0 to 100.
Height is defined by aspPref[3]=0 to 100.

The following defines 2D ROIs over a 2D spectrum:
2 H1 C13        7.992   6.912   32.874  40.482  Roi9 2 30
2 H1 C13        9.904   9.103   80.171  64.288  Roi9 2 30
The first two frequencies are for the first nucleus, the next two frequencies are for the second nucleus. 

The following defines 2D ROIs over a 1D spectrum:
2 H1 amp        9.904   9.103   0.171   0.288   Roi9 2 30
The third and fourth floating values are vertical height in absolute value.

The aspRoi command can be used to query rois.
aspRoi:$e,$num
will set $e =1 if rois are being displayed, 0 otherwise. The optional
$num will return the number of rois.
aspRoi($index):$f1,$f2,$ht
where $index goes from 1 to $num will return the frequencies and height
of the $index roi.
aspRoi($f1,$f2,$ht):$index will return the index of the roi corresponding
to the given frequencies and height. If none match, a 0 will be returned.
