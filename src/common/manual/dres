*******************************************************************************

  "Dres" analyzes the line defined by the current cursor position ("cr")
  for its linewidth (width at half-height).  If there is a second argument 
  with a fractional height, the linewidth is measured at this height.
  The digital resolution is also measured.  These measurements may be returned 
  in the corresponding output parametersa Optional third and fourth return values
  will return the peak frequencies at the requested height.  An optional freq
  may be supplied to override "cr" as the line's frequency. For example, if cr
  is set to the frequency of the line, then
    dres:$width,$res,cr,$tmp delta=cr-$tmp
  will set the cursors to the frequencies of the line at half-height

  "Dsn" measures the signal to noise ratio of the spectrum.  This
  calculation proceeds in two steps.  First, the intensity of the
  largest peak in the spectral range defined by "sp" and "wp"
  is measured.  Then the noise is measured in the spectral region
  defined by the position of the two cursors.  This ratio may
  be returned in an output parameter.  The noise value may also
  be returned in a second output parameter.  The noise region may
  be specified by supplying the lowfield and highfield frequencies
  of that region as parameters.

  The noise value returned from "dsn" is not scaled by "vs".  The
  interrelations between the signal-to-noise ratio, the noise and
  peak intensities may be illustrated as follows.

  dsn:$sn,$noise
  peak:$signal

  In this case, $sn will be equal to $signal / $noise / vs.
