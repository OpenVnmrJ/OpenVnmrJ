************************************************************************

This macro imports a list of experiments into the Study Queue.  The
list may be a "comma-separated-value" list generated by a PC program.

Usage:  To use the macro, you must first start an automation run in
  a user account configured as a walkup user.

Syntax:  csvimport( <filename <, rack, zone>> )
  If no filename is specified, the user is asked for one.
  If rack and zone are not specified for a 768AS or Gilson
    autosampler, the user is asked for them.

The file format is as follows.  

  The first line is a header, and must start with the text 'SAMPLE#'.
  Each subsequent line specifies a sample to be run, with entries
    as follows.

    SAMPLE#  an integer number (treated as a string)
    USER     an operator name
    EXPLIST  a list of protocols, separated by '-', e.g. Proton-Hmqc
    SOLVENT  any of the solvents in an appdir solvents file
    TEXT     the remainder of the line is treated as text 

Note that the sample information must all be contained on one line,
and fields are space- or tab-separated.  Commas, carraige returns,
and line feeds are not allowed.  

Example:
    SAMPLE#  USER    EXPLIST         SOLVENT  TEXT
    1        user1   Proton-Carbon   CDCl3    C13 test
    2        walkup  Proton-Hmqc     D2O      Hmqc test
