*******************************************************************************

ds:

  "ds" displays a single spectrum.   Integral display is controlled by the
  parameter "intmod".
    intmod="off"       turns off the integral display.
    intmod="full"      displays the entire integral.
    intmod="partial"   displays every other integral region.
  Parameter entry after a spectrum has been displayed with the "ds" command
  will cause the spectrum to be updated.

  Two additional parameters control the behavior of the "ds" command.
  The parameter "phasing" (in the "global" parameter set) controls the
  percentage of the spectrum that is updated during interactive
  phasing.  This parameter can be set in the range of 10 to 100.  A
  value of 100 will cause the entire spectrum to be updated.  A value
  of 20 will cause the area between the two horizontal cursors to be
  updated.  The parameter "lvltlt" (in the "current" parameter set)
  controls the sensitivity of the interactive lvl / tlt adjustment.
  The parameter can be set to any positive real number.  It is basically
  a multiplier for the sensitivity.  The default value is 1.0.  Larger
  values will make the adjustments larger.  Smaller values will make the
  adjustments smaller.

  For arrayed 1-D spectra or for 2-D spectra, a particular trace can
  be viewed by supplying the index number as an argument.
  For 2-D data sets, spectra can be displayed from either the f1 or f2
  domain by setting "trace" equal to 'f1' or 'f2', respectively.
  Following the command "ft1d", interferograms may be viewed by
  setting "trace='f1'" and then typing "ds".


select:

  "select" is used to used to direct future actions to apply either
  to a particular spectrum in a 1D array or trace in a 2D or to a
  particular 2D plane from a 3D data set.  For 1D operations, "select"
  has the following usages:

			select('next')
			select('prev')
			select(index):r1
                        select:r1

  "select('next')" increments the 1D spectrum or trace index to the
  next one; "select('prev')" decrements it to the previous one.  If
  a non-sequential index is desired, "select(index)" can be used.
  The index of the selected spectrum can be returned to the caller
  if the command is suffixed with a colon and a parameter name, e.g.,
  r1.  If select is called with no arguments but is suffixed with a
  colon and a parameter name, it will return the current index to the
  parameter.


  For selecting various 2D planes of a 3D data set, "select" has the
  following usages:

			select('next')
			select('prev')
			select('proj')

			select('plane_type','proj')
			select('plane_type',plane_index)

  "select('next')" increments the parameter "index2" to its next
  value and sets up VNMR to be ready to display the 2D plane whose
  number is the new "index2" value.  "select('prev')" performs
  analogously except that "index2" is decremented.  "select('proj')"
  selects the 2D projection whose plane type is determined by the
  parameter "plane".  The type of plane can also be specified in the
  arguments to "select" in the 2D mode, e.g., select('plane_type') where
  'plane_type' can take the values 'f1f3', 'f2f3', and 'f1f2'.  The
  plane_index (number of the plane to be selected) can also be speci-
  fied.  The parameters "plane" and "index2" serve to indicate the
  exact 2D plane that is currently viewable by VNMR.  Note that index2
  can not be entered from the keyboard.  That is,  one can not select
  a new 2D plane by changing the value of index2.  One must use the
  command "select".
  

  When VNMR is first booted up, "select" is in 1D mode.  "select"
  enters into 2D mode if any of the key words 'f1f3', 'f2f3', 'f1f2',
  or 'proj' are present in the argument list.  The "ds" and "jexp"
  commands reset "select" back to the 1D mode.


  ds can take several options :

	toggle	- switch between BOX and CURSOR mode.
	restart	- redraw cursor if it has been turned off.
	expand	- toggle between expanded and full view of spectrum.
	spwp	- interactively adjust start and width of spectrum display.
	phase	- enter interactive phasing mode.
	thresh	- interactively adjust threshold.
	z	- interactively set integral resets.
	dscale	- toggle scale below spectrum on and off.
	lvltlt	- interactively adjust lvl and tlt parameters.
	scwc	- interactively adjust start and width of chart.
	noclear	- start or restart the ds display without clearing the graphics screen.
	exit   	- exit the ds display, leaving a non-interactive dss display
	again   - restart the ds display

  The ds command will return to a calling macro whether line displays (dpf) or integral
  displays (dpir) are active. ds('dpf'):$e will set $e equal to 1 or 0 depending upon
  whether dpf is active or not. Similarly, ds('dpir'):$e will set $e equal to 1 or 0
  depending upon whether dpir is active or not.
