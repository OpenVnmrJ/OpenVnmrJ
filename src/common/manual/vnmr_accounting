vnmr_accounting  -   Shell script to start the accounting package
doAcct           -   Sample shell script for running accounting in a
                     non-interactive way.

The vnmr_accounting script calls the OpenVnmrJ accounting package.
See the VnmrJ Administration Guide for details on setting up the
accounting for login accounting and / or data acquisition accounting.

This manual documents new arguments that have been introduced to allow
one to run the accounting package in a non-interactive way. It also
documents a sample doAcct script for routine accounting. The doAcct
script might be called from a "cron" job once a month to do the accounting.

Several new arguments are supported by vnmr_accounting and the accounting
program.  The arguments are all case-insensitive.

  -saveDir <dirName>  Specify the directory into which the monthly
                      acctLog.xml, CSV and summary files will be put.
                      The directory will be created if it does not exist.

  -cut                Cut records from /vnmr/adm/accounting/acctLog.xml.
                      If a -saveDir argument is present, it will copy the
                      file before cutting the records.
                      If an -endDate  is specified, any records older than
                      that date will be cut. The default is to use the
                      "today" date.
 
  -startDate <date>   Can be used optionally to select a beginning date for
                      operations that require a range of dates. It defaults
                      to Jan 1 2001, which should be older that all records
                      in the acctLog.xml file. The format is "mmm dd yyyy"
                      or "today". For example, "Oct 14 2014" or
                      "Feb 03 2018" or "today"

  -endDate  <date>    Can be used optionally to select the end date for
                      operations that require a range of dates. It defaults
                      to the "today" date. The format is the same as for
                      the -startDate argument.

  -in  <fileName>     This will use an acctLog.xml file other than the one
                      in /vnmr/adm/accounting. This can be used to select
                      a previously saved acctLog.xml.

  -summary            Generate a summary of the month's account as a text file.
                      This will be similar to the view one sees when one clicks
                      the "Display all summary" button. It will be called
                      summary.txt in the directory specified by the -saveDir
                      argument.  See doAcct below for details on how this
                      text file may be converted into a png file.

  -summaryCsv         Generate the CSV file one gets when one clicks the
                      "Display all summary" followed by clicking the
                      "Save for Excel"  button. It will be called summary.csv
                      in the directory specified by the -saveDir argument.

  -acctCsv            Generate a CSV file one gets when one clicks the
                      "Display this invoice"  followed by clicking
                      "Save for Excel"  for each operator.  The files will be
                      named <operator>.csv in the directory specified by
                      the -saveDir argument.  

If the -saveDir argument is not specified, then if the "cut" operation is
performed, the acctLog.xml will not be saved prior to cutting the records.
If the -saveDir argument is not specified, then if the "summary", "summaryCsv",
or "acctCsv" operations are performed, the resulting files will be saved
in /vnmr/adm/accounting.

If any argument other than the "-in" argument is specified, the accounting
program will run in a non-interactive background mode. If only the "-in"
argument is specified, the accounting interface will display the results
for the specified acctLog.xml file.


doAcct  - sample script to generate accounting records.

The doAcct script might be called once a month by a cron job.  It collects
the accounting records in the vnmrsys directory of the OpenVnmrJ admin
account (vnmr1). It sets the saveDir argument to
~/vnmrsys/accounting/yyyy_mm_dd where yyyy_mm_dd represents the day the
doAcct script was called.

The first step is to copy the current /vnmr/adm/accounting/acctLog.xml file
to the "saveDir" directory.  The script will then "cut" all records from
the /vnmr/adm/accounting/acctLog.xml file that are older than the current day.
The cutting step is to prepare the acctLog.xml for the next month's accounting.
It is also an accounting maintenance step to prevent the acctLog.xml file
from growing to a very large size.

The next step is to generate the summary, summaryCsv, and acctCsv files from
the saved acctLog.xml file. These files are also saved in the "saveDir"
directory.

The final step in to convert the summary.txt file into a complete record as
a png file. The summary.txt file only contains the raw information. This is
combined with the files acctHeader.ps and acctTail.ps in /vnmr/adm/accounting
to generate a PostScript file. The convert program then converts the
PostScript file into a png file.

Examples of the calls are:

vnmr_accounting -saveDir $HOME/vnmrsys/accounting/2018_07_01 -cut
vnmr_accounting -saveDir $HOME/vnmrsys/accounting/2018_07_01 -in $HOME/vnmrsys/accounting/2018_07_01/acctLog.xml -summary -summaryCsv -acctCsv
