dfid<(index)>	-	Display an FID

df<(index)>	-	Display an FID
*******************************************************************************

  DFID displays a single FID.  Parameter entry after an FID
  has been displayed will cause the display to be updated.
  For arrayed 1-D experiments or for 2-D experiments, a particular
  FID can be viewed by supplying the index number as an argument.
  The FID will be left shifted by the number of complex data points
  specified by the parameter "lsfid".  The FID will also be phase
  rotated (zero order only) by the number of degrees specified by
  the parameter "phfid".  Both left shifting and phasing of the FID
  may be avoided by setting "lsfid" and "phfid" to 'n'.
  Each FID is scaled by the number of transients (ct) summed during the
  acquisition of the FID data. By setting the parameter
  wtfile='noCtScaling' this CT scaling will be turned off.

  DF is identical in function to DFID


  dfid can take several options :

	toggle	- switch between BOX and CURSOR mode.
	restart	- redraw cursor if it has been turned off.
	expand	- toggle between expanded and full view of fid.
	imaginary - toggle display of imaginary fid on and off.
	sfwf	- interactively adjust start and width of fid display.
	phase	- enter interactive phasing mode.
	dscale	- toggle scale below fid on and off.
	fidshim	- set the parameter "fidarea" to the area of the FID.

  The df('fidshim') option sets the global parameter "fidarea" to one of
  two values, depending on whether the parameter "displaymode" contains
  an 'r', for real mode. If interactive FID shimming is in progress, the
  parameter "fidscanmode" is used instead of "displaymode". This is the
  mechanism FID shimming uses to update the value in the FID-shim window.
  If it is in real mode, the value is calculated as the sum of the absolute
  value of the real points divided by the number of real points. If it is
  not in real mode, the value calculated is the sum of the square roots of the
  real squared plus imaginary squared divided by the number of complex pairs.
  If the global parameter "fidnorm" exists, the value of "fidarea" is the
  product of "fidnorm" and one of the above sums.
