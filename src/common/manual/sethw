sethw     -   Set values for hardware in the acquisition system
sethwshim -   Special case of sethw for setting shims.
readhw     -  Read current values of acquisiton hardware
*******************************************************************

The SETHW command (SET HardWare) allows the VNMR program to set values
for selected parameters in the acquisition hardware.

The READHW (READ HardWare) allows the VNMR program to read the current
values of these parameters in the acquisition hardware.

Parameters which can be accessed include the parameters of the lock
system and the shim DACs.  They are:

	lockpower, lockgain, lockphase, z0	"lock system parameters"
        z1, z2, z3, z4, z1c, z2c		"axial shim DACs"
        x1, y1, xz, yz, xy, x2y2, x3, y3	"non-axial shims"
        z5, xz2, yz2, zx2y2, zxy	"special shims for Oxford magnets"

Spinning speed control is provided with the keyword spin.  Temperature
control is provided with the keyword temp.  You cannot set any other
parameters in the same sethw command if either of these two keywords is
selected.

You can also set the location for the sample currently in the magnet on
ASM systems (robot arm, sample tray) with the 'loc' parameter:

        sethw('loc',5)

Remember this is different from the meaning of the 'loc' parameter in VNMR;
the latter refers to the location of the next sample to be placed in the
magnet!  This parameter is not available from readhw.

The SETHW command accepts parameter name - value in pairs as arguments.
You must specify at least one parameter name - value.  An example:

	sethw('z1c',30,'z2c',-50)

To set the spinning speed to 20 Hz., one would use:

        sethw('spin',20)

A maximum of ten parameters can be set using this command.

The sethw command has an additional format, useful when changing the probe
in a system with VT regulation.  Enter:

        sethw('vt','reset')

after installing a new probe in the magnet and attaching the VT controller
interface to the probe.  This will permit the VT controller to regulate
the temperature.  No other parameters can be modified in the same command.

As an alternate, you can turn the VT controller unit off and then back on.

The sethw('start',1) will start an acquisition which was initiated with a
go('prep') command.  Before an acquisition starts, the console status is
reported as "Idle".  During the time between the go('prep') command and
the sethw('start',1) command, the console status will be reported as
"Ready".  The readhw('status') will return the current status of the console.
The status is returned as an integer.  The mapping of the integer value to
the keyword displayed as the Status is:
Inactive  	  0
Idle		  10
Active		  15
Working		  16
Ready		  17
Acquiring	  20
Pre-Acquisition	  25
VT Regulation	  30
Spin Regulation	  40
Auto Set Gain	  50
Auto Locking	  60
Lock: Find Res.	  61
Lock: Adj. Power  62
Lock: Adj. Phase  63
Shimming	  70
Changing Sample	  80
Retrieving Sample 81
Loading Sample	  82
Interactive	  90
Tuning		  100
The sethw('status',value) command can be used to set the console status, which is
displayed in the console status monitor. The value can be a string 'idle' or 'shim',
which sets the status to numbers 10 and 70, respectively.  Any other string will set
the status to number 16. The value passed can also be an integer, which will set the
above status values. For example, the sethw('status','shim') and sethw('status',70)
are equivalent.



Normally the SETHW command sends the new values to the acquisition
console, verify these new values and then updates the corresponding VNMR
parameters.  Use the 'nowait' keyword to cause SETHW to just send the new
values to the console, without verifying them or changing VNMR parameters.
The 'wait' keyword is accepted to confirm the default mode of operation.

The 'wait' or 'nowait' keyword must either be the first or the last
argument.

The READHW command obtains the current settings for each parameter
passed to it as arguments.  An example:

	readhw('z1c','z2c','z1','z2')

This command obtains the values for the coarse and fine Z1 and Z2 shim
coils.

The settings can be stored in VNMR variables if the variables are part
of the return value list.  An example:

	readhw('z1c','z2c','z1','z2'):r1,r2,r3,r4

This command will store the current setting for the coarse Z1 shim in
'r1', the coarse Z2 shim in 'r2', the fine Z1 shim in 'r3' and the fine
Z2 shim in 'r4'.

If no return variable is supplied, the setting will be displayed in the
status window of VNMR.

The sethwshim command is a special case of sethw. It takes two arguments, the shim name
and shim value, as in sethwshim('z1',1000)
This command is equivalent to sethw('nowait','z1',1000), with sethw messages suppressed,
except in the case where there may be additional limits on the range of values certain
shims may be set to. The return value of sethwshim will be the actual value sent to the
shim hardware.
