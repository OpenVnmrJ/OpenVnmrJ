ovjUpdate - make a patch of system files 

When installing OpenVnmrJ on a new PC, it is useful to have system files from
the previously running system. The ovjUpdate script may be copied to the PC
running the previously used VnmrJ / OpenVnmrJ. Running it will make a patch
that can be installed on the new PC. Note that if you are installing OpenVnmrJ
on a PC that already has a functioning VnmrJ or OpenVnmrJ system on it, this
script is not required.

The ovjUpdate script collects the system (conpar) and printer information.
It collects solvent, probe, shim, gradient shim, imaging gradient information, imaging ECC
information, fastmap, mollib, amp table, cryomon, dicom, gradient shimlib, tune,
and accounting information. Importantly, it also collects user and operator
information. It builds a patch named custom_previousInstall.ptc. This can then be
copied to the PC with the new OpenVnmrJ installation and installed by running
  patchinstall custom_previousInstall.ptc
