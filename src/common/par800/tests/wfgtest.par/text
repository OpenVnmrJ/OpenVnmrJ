Test parameters for control of the AM/PM
transmitter board by the waveform
generator
OPTION = 1 yields the shaped pulse `obspat`
of length `pw` on RF channel 1; trigger on
this channel
OPTION = 2 yields the shaped pulse `decpat`
of length `pw` on RF channel 2; trigger on
this channel
OPTION = 3 yields the shaped pulse `dec2pat`
of length `pw` on RF channel 3; trigger on
this channel
OPTION = 4 yields the shaped pulse `obspat
of length `pw` on RF channel 1 and the
shaped pulse `decpat` of length `p1` on
RF channel 2; trigger on channel 1
OPTION = 5 yields the shaped pulse `obspat
of length `pw` on RF channel 1 and the
shaped pulse `dec2pat` of length `p1` on
RF channel 3; trigger on channel 1
OPTION = 6 yields the shaped pulse `decpat
of length `pw` on RF channel 2 and the
shaped pulse `dec2pat` of length `p1` on
RF channel 3; trigger on channel 2
