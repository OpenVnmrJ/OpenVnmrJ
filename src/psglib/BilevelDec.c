/* BilevelDec.c - bilevel decoupling test sequence.

                Ref. E. Kupce, R. Freeman, G. Wider and K. Wuethrich,
                     J. Magn. Reson., Ser A, vol. 122, p. 81 (1996)

                Requires the following parameters:
                BLdec - flag for bilevel decoupling during acquisition
                jBL - J-coupling to be decoupled by bi-level decoupling
                nBL - number of high power pulses, must be a power of 2. Larger
                      nBL suppresses higher order sidebands and requires more
                      RF power. The default is 2.
                BLxpwr - extra power level for low power decoupling. This is
                         added to the internal setting of the low power
                         decoupling level to reduce the inner sidebands.
                BLorder - 1, suppresses only high order sidebands; requires
                             the shortest duration of high power decoupling.
                             The sub-harmonic sidebands can be suppressed by
                             using high peak amplitude decoupling sequences,
                             such as clean-WURST or sech. The inner sidebands
                             can be suppressed by increasing the extra power
                             level, BLxpwr for the low power  decoupling.
                          2, suppresses all outer sidebands including the
                             sub-harmonic;
                             this is the DEFAULT option. The inner sidebands
                             can be reduced by increasing the extra power
                             level, BLxpwr for low power  decoupling.
                          3, suppresses all sidebands including the inner
                             sidebands; requires the longest duration of
                             high power decoupling;

               Note: This setup uses explicit acquisition (dsp must be set to
                     dsp = 'n') and depends on the digitization rate. As a
                     result, the decoupling pulse duration depends on spectral
                     width, sw. This can have some limitations, particularly
                     for relatively large J-couplings and relatively small sw.
