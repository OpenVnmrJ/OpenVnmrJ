    Use convoluted SLP 180 to decouple carbonyls during t2. 

    Set dm = 'nny' [13C decoupling during acquisition]
    One dipsi-3 cycle is 217.33*p1
      e.g. if p1= 36us a single dipsi cycle is 7.8ms

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for hypercomplex in t1 and t2.

    Typical acquisition times are 28 ms [t1], 10 ms [t2], and 47 ms [t3]
       with 128 complex [t1], 32 complex [t2], and 512 real [t3].
