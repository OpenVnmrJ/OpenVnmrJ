<body>
The Shuffler shows files/objects based on the attributes of the files as
specified by the user in the shuffler statement.


Objects matching the search criteria are shuffled to the top of the list.
The objects that do not meet the criteria are shuffled to the bottom.
There are only two catagories, matched, and failed to match.
Within those two catagories, they are sorted as per request.

Main Components
  The shuffler is composed of three distinct parts. These are listed here
  and will be discussed separately.
    - The java code in vnmrj
	This code takes care of the user interface.  When it needs to
	do something with the Database, it makes a request of db_manager
	and gets results back from db_manager.
    - db_manager
	This program is written in C.  It takes information from 
	vnmrj, and creates SQL commands which it then sends to Postgres.
    - a relational database named Postgres (postmaster).
	This is a free open-source relational database which uses the SQL
	language.


Communications between vnmrj and db_manager
  When vnmrj is started, it initiates a socket, then starts db_manager
  with that socket address as an argument.  Communications is entirely
  done through that socket.  db_manager is the slave in that it is
  always waiting for something to come over the socket, or is processing
  something that it has received over the socket.  It cannot initate
  communications with vnmrj.  It only speaks when spoken to.

  When vnmrj expects a response from db_manager, it waits on the socket
  thus hanging the gui until the result is complete.  This is currently
  less than one second for any calls, so it is not a problem yet.
  Later, it would probably be better to put the socket listener
  in a separate thread.


Communications between db_manager and Postgres (postmaster)
  All communications with Postgres are via library routines supplied as 
  part of the Postgres package.   When db_manager is started, it 
  initialized communications with the Postgres deamon by calling
  PQsetdb() which is one of the library routines.  SQL commands are
  sent to the deamon with the routine, PQexec(), from the library.


db_manager
  db_manager is used for two purposes.  It is started by vnmrj to
  handle DB requests, and it can be run as a standalone utility
  to destroy, create and fill a database.

  Searching
    When running as a connection to vnmrj, its primary task is to
    translate the incoming information into SQL commands.  For a
    search, this is not a simple task.  Here is an example of SQL
    commands created for a simple search.

      Return Matching entries:
	SELECT "filename", "owner", "time_run", "filename", "fullpath", 
	       "hostname", arch_lock, UPPER ("filename") AS sortkey 
	FROM vnmr_data 
	WHERE exptype = 'dept' AND 
	      classification = 'fid data' AND  
	      time_run >= '1/1/1997'  AND  
	      (tag0 = 'My Tag' OR tag1 = 'My Tag' OR tag2 = 'My Tag' ) AND
	      owner in ('glenns' ,'sylvia' )  
	ORDER BY sortkey ASC;

      Return NonMatching entries:
	SELECT "filename", "owner", "time_run", "filename", "fullpath", 
	       "hostname", arch_lock, UPPER ("filename") AS sortkey 
	FROM vnmr_data 
	WHERE ((exptype != 'dept' OR 
		classification != 'fid data' OR  
		time_run < '1/1/1997' ) OR  
	        (tag0 != 'My Tag' AND tag1 != 'My Tag' AND tag2 != 'My Tag ') OR
	       owner in ('glenns' ,'sylvia' ) )  OR  
	      owner in ('vnmr1' ,'rudy' ,'george')  
	ORDER BY sortkey ASC;

    See the function header comments for the function search_db() for more
    details on how the search commands is created.

  other commands accepted by db_manager from vnmrj
    is_unique_request
    remove_file 
    add_file
    list_request
    list_attributes
    get_attr_value
    clear_out_table
    fill_a_table

  filldb
    At the inner level, filldb goes to the directory given, and
    executes a unix "find" command to recurvisly find all of the files
    of a given type.  It then takes that list and attempts to add
    each file to the DB.  If the file already exists, it skips it.

    It needs to be expanded to look for entries in the DB whos
    files are gone and eliminate them from the DB.

  Tags
    implementing tags is different than other attritutes.  A given
    row in the DB table, can contain more than one "tag" value.  And of
    course, each tag can be assigned to more that one row.
    The way this is to be implemented is to have columns in the DB
    of tag0, tag1, tag2 ... as needed.  Then each row can have several
    tags.  When a new tag is added, the code will determine if a new
    column is required and if so one will be created in the DB with the
    name tag# where # is the next numeric value.

    This complicates the search a little since searching for a tag
    of "My Tag" requires comparing all tag columns.  See the example
    under "Searching" above.
    
    

Postgres (postmaster)
  Web information
    http://www.postgresql.org/index.html
    http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/PostgreSQL-HOWTO-32.html  (Tutorial)

  General
    PostgreSQL is a sophisticated Object-Relational DBMS, supporting almost
    all SQL constructs, including subselects, transactions, and user-defined
    types and functions. It is the most advanced open-source database available
    anywhere. (Quote from the web site)

vnmrj - Shuffler parts
  Spotter Button (Upper Left)
    Clicking this button will bring up a menu with choices for the
    shuffler statement.  See Cooper Shuffler p. 6.  All general forms of
    the shuffler statement will be in this menu.  As noted below, some
    items in the shuffler statement will allow further choices.  Once the
    user selects one of these general forms, an appropriate sentence
    (shuffler statement) will be displayed in the top of the panel.

    The top of the menu will contain "shuffler statement" files saved by
    this investigator that can be read back in.  These are saved with the
    Floppy Disk icon.

  Shuffler Statement
    The plan in progress for the shuffler statement is to make it a
    configurable statement composed of a number of fixed items.
    There will then be a number of these statements defined in a
    configuration file.  The value for each item in the statement
    translates directly into information sent to db_manager to do a search.

    The configuration file will be in an XML format and parsed with
    the XML parser already used for the panel templates.

  Import
    As stated on Cooper Shuffler p. 11, the import button opens a dialog
    for importing new items into the shuffler. Also see Cooper Vnmr p. 21.

  Tag
    See Cooper Shuffler p. 10, 11 & 14.  Clicking this item brings up a
    menu with all of the current tags listed. Tag is
    pretty well described by Cooper.  See also Cooper Vnmr p 9 & 10.

  Floppy Disk icon (Save)
    See Cooper Shuffler p. 16.

  Choice of 3 attributes for display
    See Cooper Shuffler p. 5 & 9.  On p. 9, where should we get the list
    of attributes for the columns.  Should it contain all attributes?
    Since that included all acq params, it would be too many.  Should it
    be configurable?  Or, can we come up with a good list to hard code in?

  Shuffle Results Panel
    The results of a shuffle are displayed as a table in a scrollable window.
    When rows are put into the table, objects are created for each row
    (ShufflerItem).  Items matching the shuffler statement are highlighted,
    and non-matching items are not.

  Drag and Drop
    When a row is dragged and dropped, the ShufflerItem
    for that row is accessable to give all of the needed information about
    that row.  I don't know how this would work for dragging and dropping
    multiple rows at once.???

  History (<>)
    The < and > buttons allow going backwards and forwards on previous
    shuffles.  Each shuffle's information is saved in a Hashtable, and
    the list of Hashtable's is saved in a Vector (StatementHistory).

User Directory Files (/vnmr/adm/users)
  userList
    syntax:
      username:passwd:Long Name:dir, dir, dir, ...:user level

    This file needs to contain an entry for each user of vnmrj.
    username => the unix login name
    passwd   => not used yet, but a place for the password to be kept
    Long Name => Text comment or name
    dir, dir  => A list of directories where data is stored.
		 The first one is the default location to store data.
		 All of these will be used by filldb to fill the DB
		 with this users data files.
		 These directories can be separated by "," or by "\return"
		 (that is "\" followed by a return or newline).
    user level => Currently <= 3 are Sylvia level
			     > 3 are Rudy level
		  Wanda is not used yet but is presumably level 0.
    

  access
    syntax:
      user: list of comma separated users and groups

    Example:
      glenns: sylvia, vnmr1, ChemDept, nmrlab

    This file needs to contain an entry for every vnmrj user.  The users
    and groups listed will be the ones whose files this user can see.
    The DB contains files for all users, but a given user can only
    see the files of certain people and groups. "all" is a legimate
    entry, expecially for wanda.
	wanda: all

  group
    syntax:
      groupname:Long Name: user1, user2, user3

    The group names create here are used in the "access" file and are
    used in the pulldown menu of choices in the shuffler statement.
    So, in a statement like  "Show vnmr data by xxxx", the xxxx will
    give a menu of choices including the groups from the access file
    for this user.

Archiving:
  An Idea on Archiving:  Create a single "Archive" database.  When data is 
  archived to some media, add it to the "Archive" database, and fill in an
  attribute with the media id of some kind. Then remove each item which as
  been archived. Then to retrieve this archived stuff, the user would need
  to look at the archive database and find out what specific tape it was
  on.  Then the sysadmin or someone would have to read the tape in.  Then
  the local database would have to import the new item/items desired. Then
  the user could open an archived dataset.
