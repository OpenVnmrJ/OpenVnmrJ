 * workq.h
 *
 * This header file defines the interfaces for a "work queue"
 * manager. A "manager object" is created with several
 * parameters, including the required size of a work queue
 * entry, the maximum desired degree of parallelism (number of
 * threads to service the queue), and the address of an
 * execution engine routine.
 *
 * The application requests a work queue entry from the manager,
 * fills in the application-specific fields, and returns it to
 * the queue manager for processing. The manager will create a
 * new thread to service the queue if all current threads are
 * busy and the maximum level of parallelism has not yet been
 * reached.
 *
 * The manager will dequeue items and present them to the
 * processing engine until the queue is empty; at that point,
 * processing threads will begin to shut down. (They will be
 * restarted when work appears.)
