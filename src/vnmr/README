Special versions of Vnmrbg are put in executables: Vnmrbg.gxyzfit###

Corresponding versions of gxyzmap###.c may be found also.

Changes:
001: gxyzfit accepts 2 arguments:
    First is # of shims
        -- defaults to value from file
	-- ignored if there is a second argument.
    Second argument is the minimum weight singular value to accept,
    relative to the largest weight. Vectors with weights less than
    (tol * maxWt) will not contribute to the solution. Try 0.02.

002: gxyzfit accepts 2 arguments:
    First is # of shims
        -- defaults to value from file
	-- ignored if it's value is 0.
    Second argument is the significance value a solution vector
    must have to be included in the solution. Try 0.90.

003: Combine 001 and 002; gxyzfit accepts 3 arguments:
    1. # of shims or 0
    2. Min singular value to accept as fraction of max singular value (e.g. 0.02).
    3. Min significance probability to include a vector in solution matrix (e.g. 0.95).

004: Arguments same as 003.
    Does fit using shimmaps that are divided by their respective offset values.
    This should avoid introducing a bias towards using a shim coil that needs more
    current to produce a similar effect as another shim coil.

005: Added optional 4th argument
    Set 4th arg to the string 'zero' to make the fit routine try to back out the
    unneeded high order shims. It probably only makes sense to do this once,
    as a first step in the gradient shimming. But maybe it could be beneficial
    later on also. I think it will always need to be followed by some normal
    iterations to get a good fit. Try:
    gxyzfit(0, 0.001, 0.99, 'zero')

gxyzfit.009: Adds required "shimtype" argument
    The usage is now:
        gzxyfit <shimset> <shimtype> <minWeight> <minProbability> ['zero']
    shimset: the vnmr parameter value, e.g.: 9
    shimtype: vnmr parameter, e.g.: Oxford40
    minWeight: the min weight singular value to keep in the solution vector,
               relative to the largest weighted term, e.g.: 0.001
    minProbability: the min probability of statistical significance to keep
                    a term in the solution vector, e.g.: 0.99
    'zero': optional argument biases the algorithm towards minimizing the
            shim currents, instead of minimizing the incremental change in
	    the currents. Recommendation: use this argument.

    This version _requires_ that the shim power data be in the system
    directory under gxyzshim: e.g.: /vnmr/gxyzshim/shimtab/shimset9_Oxford40


gxyzfit.010: Adds required "minChisq" argument
   New usage:
        gzxyfit <shimset> <shimtype> <minWeight> <minProbability> <minChisq> ['zero']
    shimset: the vnmr parameter value, e.g.: 9
    shimtype: vnmr parameter, e.g.: Oxford40
    minWeight: the min weight singular value to keep in the solution vector,
               relative to the largest weighted term, e.g.: 0.001
    minProbability: the min probability of statistical significance to keep
                    a term in the solution vector, e.g.: 0.99
    minChisq: the min chi-square improvement that a term must provide in order
              to be included in the fit, as a fraction of the minimum chi-square.
	      This measures whether a term is important to the fit, rather than
	      just statistically significant, e.g.: 0.1
    'zero': optional argument biases the algorithm towards minimizing the
            shim currents, instead of minimizing the incremental change in
	    the currents. Recommendation: use this argument.

    Fixes a problem in 009 where the fitted values were not printed properly in
    the xyshim.fit file.

    In this version, the shim power values are read by default from the file
    ".../vnmrsys/3Dshimlib/data/shimpower". I recommend that the appropriate
    ".../shimsetN_SHIMTYPE" file be copied to this location before calling
    gxyzfit. For the final version, compiled into Vnmrbg, the gxyzshimpwr
    macro may be modified to return power factors for each shim.
