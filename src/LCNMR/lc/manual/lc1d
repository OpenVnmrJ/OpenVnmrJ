lc1d -   Set up initial parameters for LC-NMR experiments
***************************************************************************

Recalls initial LC-NMR parameters from the /vnmr/stdpar directory or
from the user's stdpar directory if the appropriate file exists there.
Any changes made to the files in these directories will be reflected in
setup.  The file /vnmr/stdpar/lc1d.par contains the "default" parameters 
for LC-NMR spectra,  and hence should be modified as desired to produce 
spectra under desirable conditions.

This macro is typically run by using the corresponding button in the menu 
system.  No options are supported.  After running this, the solvent 
parameter can be set by choosing from the list of solvents listed in 
/vnmr/solvents.
