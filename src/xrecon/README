Xrecon - External Reconstruction
================================

This is Xrecon, a collection of magnetic resonance image reconstruction
routines tuned to read data acquired on Varian MRI Systems.
It has been developed to work externally and independently of the Varian data
acquisition software VnmrJ.

The routines provided here link against the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) and
the Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (FFTW) library of subroutines.
The GSL is free software published under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
The FFTW is free software published under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
As such it is a requirement that the routines provided here are also published
under the GPL.

To publish under the GPL two elements must be added to each source file:
1. A copyright notice with the names of all contributors.
2. A statement of copying permission saying the program is distributed under
   the terms of the GNU General Public License.

A copy of the license itself should also be included.

Xrecon is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
