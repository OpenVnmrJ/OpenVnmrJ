{"OVERVIEW\n",
 "\n",
 "  Pulsetool is a utility designed to display and examine shaped r.f. pulses.\n",
 "  The standard pulse template file format is: \"phase  amplitude  time-count\",\n",
 "  where phase is in degrees, amplitude is a value between 0 and 1023, and\n",
 "  time-count is an integer which describes the relative time duration of the\n",
 "  step.  The general features of this program are:\n",
 "\n",
 "  The amplitude and phase are displayed in the small windows at the top of\n",
 "  the display, along with the effective frequency of the pulse, the\n",
 "  quadrature components of the pulse, and its Fourier transform.  The\n",
 "  contents of any of the smaller windows may be selected for display in the\n",
 "  large graphics window in the center of the screen.\n",
 "\n",
 "  Between the small windows at the top of the display and the large central\n",
 "  graphics window is the \"control panel\", home to a number of buttons which\n",
 "  perform various operations, or activate the routines described below.\n", 
 "\n",
 "  Below the main graphics window is a panel which contains miscellaneous\n",
 "  information about the current pulse and display status.  The \"Directory\",\n",
 "  \"File name\", \"Pulse length\", \"Vertical scale\" and \"Vertical reference\"\n",
 "  fields display current information which may be altered by the user.  The\n",
 "  \"Steps\", \"Fourier size\", \"Power factor\" and \"Integral\" fields are advisory\n",
 "  only, and may not be entered or changed by the user.  \"Power factor\" is\n",
 "  calculated when a pulse is loaded, and is the mean square amplitude of the\n",
 "  pulse.  A square pulse has a power factor of 1.  The \"Integral\" of the\n",
 "  pulse is an attempt to calculate the tip-angle per unit time and B1 field\n",
 "  strength.  This number is strictly valid only for pulses which are\n",
 "  modulated in amplitude only, and may be used to determine the B1 field\n",
 "  required to obtain, for example, a 90 degree tip with a Sinc pulse.  To do\n",
 "  this, just divide the desired tip angle (in revolutions) by the product of\n",
 "  the integral value and the pulse length (in msec).  The result will be the\n",
 "  required B1 field strength, in kHz.\n",
 "\n",
 "  The directory system may be viewed, and pulse files selected for loading\n",
 "  through the use of the \"Files\" button.\n",
 "\n",
 "  Simulation of the actual reponse to a pulse, based on Bloch equation\n",
 "  calculations, is available by selecting the \"Simulation\" button.\n",
 "\n",
 "  A number of \"standard\" pulses may be created, with attributes tailored\n",
 "  through the \"Create\" utility.\n",
 "\n",
 "  The data currently displayed in the main graphics window may be saved with\n",
 "  the \"Save\" button or written out to a file for printing on a PostScript\n",
 "  printer with the \"Print\" button.  The default filename for the Save or\n",
 "  Print operation will be displayed in the main button panel and may be\n",
 "  changed by typing over it.  When the \"Save\" or \"Print\" button is pushed a\n",
 "  second time, the specified file is created in the directory from which the\n",
 "  pulsetool program was started.  If an absolute pathname (starting with a \"/\")\n",
 "  precedes the filename, then the Save or Print operation writes to this\n",
 "  file instead.  Absolute pathnames are not updated automatically to reflect\n",
 "  changes in the contents of the main plot window.\n",
 "END"},

{"DIRECTORY AND FILE OPERATIONS\n",
 "\n",
 "File selection:\n",
 "\n",
 "  Both the working directory, and the pulse template file name may be\n",
 "  specified by direct entry into the \"Directory\" and \"Pulse name\" fields\n",
 "  found in the panel at the bottom of the display (use the <delete> key\n",
 "  to erase characters, if necessary, and type in the desired name, followed\n",
 "  by a <return> to indicate completion).  When the \"Pulse name\" field is\n",
 "  selected, a <return> will cause the named file to be loaded and displayed.\n",
 "\n",
 "  Alternatively, the \"Files\" button causes a pop-up window to be displayed,\n",
 "  listing the contents of the current directory.  A trailing \"/\" following\n",
 "  a member of the list indicates a sub-directory, and an \"*\" an executable\n",
 "  file.  The \"Load\", \"Chdir\", and \"Edit\" buttons operate on an item\n",
 "  selected from this listing with the left mouse button:\n",
 "\n",
 "  The \"Load\" button causes the selected file to be read, and displayed in\n",
 "  the graphics windows.  If the file does not correspond to the proper\n",
 "  format for pulse template files, an error message will be displayed.\n",
 "  Comment lines beginning with the character \"#\" are ignored.  Descriptive\n",
 "  information about the pulse is displayed in the bottom panel:  the name of\n",
 "  the file; the number of steps in the pulse; the Fourier size required to\n",
 "  do the FFT of the pulse; and a \"power factor\" calculated for the pulse,\n",
 "  based on the mean square amplitude of the pulse.\n",
 "\n",
 "  The \"Chdir\" button changes to and then lists the selected directory.\n",
 "\n",
/* "  The \"Edit\" button allows the selected file to be edited in a pop-up window\n",
 "  using the vi editor.  The \"View Contents\" button which appears along with\n",
 "  the editing window loads a copy of the edit contents at the time as if it\n",
 "  were a standard pulse template file.  The original file is unaffected.\n",
 "  (The editor may exhibit sporadic behavior at times, due to a sunview bug\n",
 "  in 3.5 SunOS.  This should be corrected with the 4.1 operating system.)\n",*/
 "\n",
 "  The \"Parent\" button changes to and then lists the parent of the current\n",
 "  directory.\n",
 "\n",
 "  The \"Save\" button located in the main control panel can be used to save\n",
 "  data currently displayed in the main graphics window to a file.  When this\n",
 "  button is selected, a second button labeled \"Done\" will appear, along with\n",
 "  a type-in field which holds the name of the file which will be created.\n",
 "  First enter an appropriate name, then select the \"Save\" button once again\n",
 "  to write the file.  Once you have entered the \"Save\" mode, you may repeat\n",
 "  this as many times as you like:  display a different attribute in the main\n",
 "  window, enter a new file name, and select \"Save\".  To exit from this mode,\n",
 "  select \"Done\".\n",
 "END"},

{"DISPLAY FEATURES\n",
 "\n",
 "Attribute selection:\n",
 "\n",
 "  The six small graphics windows at the top of the tool will initially\n",
 "  display the six different attributes of the current pulse:  amplitude,\n",
 "  phase, effective off-resonance frequency, real and imaginary quadrature\n",
 "  components, and Fourier transform.\n",
 "\n",
 "  Any of these six windows may be displayed in the large graphics window\n",
 "  by clicking in the appropriate small window with either the left or middle\n",
 "  mouse buttons.  Using the left mouse button causes the large window to be\n",
 "  cleared before drawing, and sets the clear mode to \"on.\"  The middle mouse\n",
 "  button turns off the clear mode and displays the selected attribute,\n",
 "  overlaying any current display in the large graphics window.\n",
 "\n",
 "  Repeated selection of the small Fourier transform window will result in\n",
 "  the large window cycling through the magnitude of the Fourier transform,\n",
 "  the real component, and the imaginary component.\n",
 "\n",
 "Scale and Reference:\n",
 "\n",
 "  The vertical scale may be adjusted either by clicking the middle button\n",
 "  inside the boundary of the large graphics window, or by manually entering\n",
 "  a value in the \"Vertical scale\" field of the bottom panel, ending with\n",
 "  <return>.  Using the middle mouse button causes the scale to be adjusted\n",
 "  interactively so that the active curve passes through the mouse arrow.\n",
 "  Note that no rescaling will occur if the y-value specified with the middle\n",
 "  button does not have the same sign as the actual attribute value at that\n",
 "  point on the x-axis.  A negative value may, however, be entered as a\n",
 "  vertical scale if so desired.\n",
 "\n",
 "  The vertical reference controls the vertical position of the active curve\n",
 "  on the large graphics window, representing the offset from zero measured\n",
 "  in y-axis units.  A positive value moves the curve up, and a negative\n",
 "  value moves it down.  Like the vertical scale, the vertical reference may\n",
 "  be adjusted in one of two ways:  1) a value may be entered manually into\n",
 "  the \"Vertical reference\" field in the bottom panel, or 2) the middle mouse\n",
 "  button can be used interactively anywhere in the large graphics window,\n",
 "  while simultaneously depressing the <Control> key.  In the second case,\n",
 "  the vertical reference will be set so that the curve passes through the\n",
 "  mouse arrow.\n",
 "\n",
 "  The vertical scale and reference are reset whenever an attribute is\n",
 "  selected from any of the small graphics windows.  Use this to extricate\n",
 "  yourself when things get out of hand by re-selecting the current small\n",
 "  window with the left mouse button.\n",
 "\n",
 "Cursors:\n",
 "\n",
 "  Interactive left, right, and horizontal cursors are available, and display\n",
 "  a readout of position at the bottom of the large window when active.  The\n",
 "  left cursor is activated by clicking the left mouse button inside the\n",
 "  large window.  When the left cursor is present, the right cursor may be\n",
 "  activated by clicking the right mouse button anywhere to the right of the\n",
 "  left cursor.  At this point, the right mouse button controls the position\n",
 "  of the right cursor independently, while the left mouse button will move\n",
 "  both cursors in tandem.  When both cursors are active, the control panel\n",
 "  button normally marked \"Full\" will read \"Expand\", and may be used to\n",
 "  display an expanded view of the region selected between the two cursors.\n",
 "  (Note that the clear mode will always be set to \"on\" after an \"Expand\" or\n",
 "  \"Full\" operation.)  The left and right cursors are turned off by clicking\n",
 "  the appropriate mouse button in the large window while simultaneously\n",
 "  depressing the <Control> key.\n",
 "\n",
 "  The horizontal cursor is activated with the \"Thresh\" button located\n",
 "  in the control panel.  When this cursor is active, it is controlled\n",
 "  interactively with the middle mouse button.  The interactive scale and\n",
 "  reference functions normally controlled with the middle mouse are not\n",
 "  available when the horizontal cursor is present.  Select the \"Scale\"\n",
 "  button in the control panel to turn off the horizontal cursor and\n",
 "  reactivate the scale and reference functions (vertical scale and reference\n",
 "  may be adjusted even with the horizontal cursor active by direct entry in\n",
 "  the appropriate fields in the bottom panel).\n",
 "END"},

{"SIMULATION\n",
 "\n",
 "Overview:\n",
 "\n",
 "  This routine simulates the effects of an r.f. pulse by use of the\n",
 "  classical model of nuclear spin evolution described by the Bloch\n",
 "  equations.  T1 and T2 relaxation effects are ignored, in which case the\n",
 "  evolution of a magnetization vector in the presence of an applied r.f.\n",
 "  magnetic field may be evaluated by multiplication with a 3 by 3 rotation\n",
 "  matrix.  The simulation consists simply of repeated multiplication by\n",
 "  such a matrix, whose elements are determined at each step by the values\n",
 "  of amplitude and phase found in the pulse template file, and by user\n",
 "  input values of initial magnetization, B1 field strength, pulse length,\n",
 "  and resonance offset.  The simulation is performed over one of three\n",
 "  possible independent variables:  resonance offset, B1 field strength, or\n",
 "  time, and is determined by the \"Sweep\" cycle in the small button panel.\n",  
 "\n",
 "Parameters:\n",
 "\n",
 "  Select the \"Simulation\" button in the control panel to activate the\n",
 "  Bloch Simulation sub-window.  This window consists of a panel containing\n",
 "  all required parameters (the pulse length is taken from the value in the\n",
 "  bottom panel of the main window), and a small button panel at the bottom\n",
 "  of the window.  To change the value of any of the parameters, select it\n",
 "  with the left mouse button, then delete the appropriate characters and\n",
 "  enter the desired value from the keyboard.  Parameters are updated\n",
 "  each time the \"Go\" button is selected, or when the \"Steps\" button is\n",
 "  selected with \"Index\" equal to zero.\n",
 "\n",
 "  The first three parameters in the left hand column describe the starting\n",
 "  values for the magnetization components Mx, My, and Mz, whose vector sum\n",
 "  must be less than or equal to one.  The next three fields change to\n",
 "  reflect the state of the \"Sweep\" cycle, which may toggled between \"B1\",\n",
 "  \"Freq\" and \"Time\".  When \"Freq\" is selected, the first of these fields\n",
 "  will read \"B1max\", the value of B1 at the maximum pulse amplitude.  The\n",
 "  second and third fields determine the lower and upper off-resonance\n",
 "  frequency boundaries.  When the \"Sweep\" cycle is set to \"B1\", these\n",
 "  three fields are reversed so that the first determines a constant\n",
 "  off-resonance frequency, and the remaining two determine the lower and\n",
 "  upper boundaries of the maximum B1 amplitude.  Selecting \"Time\" will\n",
 "  yield a display of the magnetization as a function of progression\n",
 "  through the pulse, at the frequency and B1 field strength specified by\n",
 "  the parameter values displayed.  In this last case, the number of steps\n",
 "  in the simulation is taken from the number of points in the pulse\n",
 "  template, and may not be altered externally.  To get finer resolution in\n",
 "  the simulation, use a pulse template with a greater number of steps.\n",
 "\n",
 "  The \"Initialize\" cycle determines if the magnetization is re-initialized\n",
 "  to the values of Mx, My, and Mz, or if the simulation uses the values at\n",
 "  each point which were the result of the previous simulation.  In this way,\n",
 "  the effect of a series of pulses may be evaluated by loading the pulse and\n",
 "  performing the simulation with \"Initialize\" set to \"Yes\", then loading the\n",
 "  next pulse, setting \"Initialize\" to \"No\", and selecting \"Go\".  Any number\n",
 "  of pulses may be concatenated in this fashion.  This feature works only\n",
 "  for \"Frequency\" and \"B1\" sweep, but not \"Time\".\n",
 "\n",
 "  When \"Time\" sweep is selected, the results may also be displayed in the\n",
 "  form of a projected 3-dimensional coordinate system, showing the path\n",
 "  of the magnetization over the course of the pulse.  This display is\n",
 "  obtained by selecting the \"3D\" button after first selecting the \"Go\"\n",
 "  button.  When the 3D display is active, the left mouse button will\n",
 "  control the viewing angle from withing the canvas region delineated by\n",
 "  the blue corner markers.  This viewing angle is described by the two\n",
 "  parameters \"phi\" (the amount of rotation about the Z-axis) and \"theta\"\n",
 "  (the declination relative to the XY-plane).  A \"family\" of trajectories\n",
 "  may be displayed by first selecting any of the small canvases with the\n",
 "  middle mouse button, then selecting the \"3D\" button.  Changing either\n",
 "  the B1 field strength, or the resonance offset followed by the \"Go\"\n",
 "  button will result in display of the result without clearing the\n",
 "  display.  To reactivate the automatic clearing feature, select any of\n",
 "  the small canvases with the left mouse button.  To see the 3D display\n",
 "  drawn in real time, enter a non-zero integer value in the \"Time\" field.\n",
 "  The appropriate value will depend on the number of steps in the pulse, and\n",
 "  the type of computer you have.  Try something like 100 for a Sparc 1.\n",
 "\n",
 "  The last parameter in this column determines the number of points at which\n",
 "  the simulation will be performed along the y-axis.  A larger number will\n",
 "  give more detail in the result, but will require proportionally more time\n",
 "  to complete.\n",
 "\n",
/* "  The \"Droop\" parameter is useful for exploring the effects of non-ideal\n",
 "  amplifier behavior.  This parameter determines the percentage decrease in\n",
 "  amplitude at the end of a pulse, and is modeled as a linear decrease\n",
 "  over the entire pulse.  A 10 percent droop, e.g., means that B1max drops\n",
 "  linearly from 100% at t=0 to 90% at the end of the pulse.  The maximum\n",
 "  allowed value is 100%.\n",
 "\n",*/
 "  The \"Index\" parameter is a counter which updates the status of the\n",
 "  simulation, and cannot be set externally.  The value displayed is the\n",
 "  number of steps in the pulse template which have been completed.\n",
 "\n",
 "  The \"Step Inc\" parameter is used by the \"Step\" button (see below) to\n",
 "  control the number of intermediate steps to be calculated.\n",
 "\n",
 "Performing a simulation:\n",
 "\n",
 "  When you have adjusted all of the parameters to your liking, you will\n",
 "  probably want to select the \"Go\" button.  This will do the simulation\n",
 "  calculations, and then display the results in the first five small\n",
 "  graphics windows, replacing (but not destroying!) the pulse information\n",
 "  which was displayed there.  The Fourier transform information remains\n",
 "  unaffected, so that comparisons may be made between this and the exact\n",
 "  simulation results.\n",
 "\n",
 "  All of the display functions which are described elsewhere are active as\n",
 "  well with the simulation data.  Additionally, the original pulse data is\n",
 "  still present in the background, and may be swapped into view with the\n",
 "  \"Display\" cycle found in the main control panel.\n",
 "\n",
 "  The \"Step\" button offers the ability to view the course of the\n",
 "  magnetization at intermediate stages through the pulse.  When this\n",
 "  function is selected,  the next \"Steps Inc\" steps of the pulse will be\n",
 "  simulated, starting at the current value of \"Index\".  The intermediate\n",
 "  result will then be displayed in the normal fashion.\n",
 "\n",
 "  During a \"Go\" simulation, a small panel containing a \"Cancel\" button\n",
 "  will pop into view.  Use this to kill the simulation if necessary (there\n",
 "  may be some delay between hitting the button and the end of the process;\n",
 "  it won't do any good to \"Cancel\" more than once).\n",
 "END"},

{"CREATE\n",
 "\n",
 "Overview:\n",
 "\n",
 "  The pulse creation routine currently offers the following pulse types:\n",
 "\n",
 "     Square                Sinc                 Gaussian\n",
 "     Hermite 90            Hermite 180          Hyperbolic secant inversion\n",
 "     Tan swept inversion   Sin/cos 90\n",
 "\n",
 "  A file containing the pulse template for any of these pulses, suitable for\n",
 "  use with the S.I.S. spectrometer, may be created from scratch with this\n",
 "  utility.  Alternatively, pulses may be created for examination only, using\n",
 "  the display capabilities of Pulsetool.  Each pulse is generated with user\n",
 "  definable parameters appropriate for the pulse in question.\n",
 "\n",
 "Creating a pulse:\n",
 "\n",
 "  When the \"Create\" button is selected, a menu of pulse types will appear.\n",
 "  Hold the right mouse button down in the \"Create\" button, select one of the\n",
 "  pulses in the resulting menu, and release the mouse button.  If you\n",
 "  decide you don't like any of the possibilities, just move the mouse arrow\n",
 "  out of the menu area, and release the button.  When a pulse type is\n",
 "  selected, a small window will appear with a brief description of the\n",
 "  characteristics of the pulse, and a set of changeable attributes whose\n",
 "  values you may alter if so desired.  The number of steps in the pulse is\n",
 "  limited to powers of 2, and may be set by clicking the left mouse button,\n",
 "  or by holding the right mouse button down and selecting the desired value\n",
 "  from the resulting menu.  All other attributes, which will vary depending\n",
 "  on the pulse type, may be altered from their default values by first\n",
 "  selecting the appropriate field with the left mouse button, deleting with\n",
 "  the <Delete> key, and typing in the desired value (a <Return> is not\n",
 "  required).\n",
 "\n",
 "  At this point, you may select one of the three buttons at the bottom of\n",
 "  the window:  \"Done\", \"Preview\", or \"Execute\":\n",
 "\n",
 "  Preview:  uses the attributes as they appear on the screen to create a\n",
 "  pulse which is loaded internally into Pulsetool.  All Pulsetool features\n",
 "  may then be used to examine and evaluate the new pulse.  Any previous\n",
 "  pulse information is deleted.\n",
 "\n",
 "  Execute:  uses the attributes as they appear on the screen to create a\n",
 "  pulse, which is written to a standard Unix file.  The name of the file is\n",
