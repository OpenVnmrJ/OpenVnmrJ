    WARNING: Be sure no C13 or other bandpass filters are in line between
    the power amplifier and the N15 bandpass filter going to the N15 port
    on the probe. This is particularly important when using a cold probe
    that has a 13C preamp. C13 bandpass filters may be used inside the
    magnet "leg". dn should be set to 'N15' and dof should be set to the
    normal offset used for N15 (typically the dof2 value).

    Connect the output of the broadband preamp or driver box to the
    N15 bandpass filter and connect this to the N15 port on the probe.
    Do not use "rfchannel" when using this sequence (it could be used
    with gNhsqc.c and rfchannel='132', for example. You will need to
    create rfchannel if this is desired (create('rfchannel','string')
    rfchannel='132'))

   
    HSQC gradient sensitivity enhanced version for N15, with options for
    TROSY on N15/H1 and for T1, T1rho, and T2 relaxation measurements of the
    N15 nuclei. Coherence transfer gradients may be z or magic-angle (using 
    triax probe).


    Standard features include optional 13C sech/tanh pulse on CO and Ca to 
    refocus 13C coupling during t1; 1D checks of N15 and H1 pulse times using 
    calN and calH; one lobe sinc pulse to put H2O back along z (the sinc 
    one-lobe is significantly more selective than gaussian, square, or seduce
    90 pulses); preservation of H20 along z during t1 and the relaxation
    delays; option of obtaining spectrum of only NH2 groups; 2H decoupling 
    option for partially-deuterated (ie NHD) groups.

    Reversed roles of coherence transfer gradient behavior to flip
    last gradient(gt1/10) instead of first(gt1) as function of phase.
i   Results in better water suppression(N.Murali,July 2004).

    Improved water suppression in 2D can be obtained by setting gzlvl0, gzlvl3 
    and gzlvl5 to zero, particularly in cryogenic probes.

                         Dealing with Radiation Damping

    Use at very high magnetic fields (>600 MHz) and/or with cryogenically-cooled probes
    can present unique problems arising from fast radiation damping. Theoretically-
    calculated power levels may be incorrect. For this reason, fine power control is
    present prior to H2O-selective shaped pulses.

    The amplitude of the flipback pulse(s) (pwHs) is adjustable around
    theoretical value (tpwrs). If tpwrsf_t < 4095.0 the value of tpwrs is increased 6db and
    values of tpwrsf_t(_d,_n) of 2048 or so should give equivalent amplitude. Severe 
    radiation damping( which happens during pwHs) can cause the optimal flip angle to differ
    from 90 degrees, so fine power should be adjusted to a value to minimize the observed 
    single-scan experiments (with ssfilter='n').

       Added control of phase of flipback pulses via H2Osinc_t.RF 
       (TROSY='n') and H2Osinc_n.RF/H2Osinc_d.RF (TROSY='y').

       The flipdown pulse H2Osinc_n.RF has fine power adjustment tpwrsf_n.
       The flipdown pulse H2Osinc_t.RF has fine power adjustment tpwrsf_t.
       The flipdown pulse H2Osinc_d.RF has fine power adjustment tpwrsf_d.

       The shaped pulses are automatically generated via the AutoCalibration process
       in BioPack. They have internal phase corrections for optimal water suppression.
       The tpwrsf_* values are determined in the AutoCalibration process and are
       stored in the active probefile. The experiment setup macro "gNhsqc" retrieves
       these values into the gNhsqc parameter set as part of the experiment setup.

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc'
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for N15 decoupling.
    Set dm3='nyn', dmm2='cwc' for 2H decoupling using 4th channel

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [N15].
    
    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give 90, -180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the 
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.



          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF gNhsqc

         
    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for gNhsqc may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('gNhsqc') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "gNhsqc".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 100ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the amide region (120 ppm).

    4. CALIBRATION OF pw AND pwN:
       calN and calH are multipliers of the first N15 and H1 90 degree pulses
       in the sequence.  They can be used to calibrate the pulses using a 1D
       spectrum.  Setting either calN or calH = 2.0 should give a S/N null (or 
       small dispersion signals) corresponding to the pulses being set at 180
       degrees.  Adjust pwN or pw, respectively, until this occurs.  An array
       of calH or calN = 1.8, 2.0, 2.2 is also convenient to judge the null at
       2.0.  calN and calH are automatically reset to 1 for 2D spectra if you   
       forget to do so.  (Note that compH and compN can be calibrated using
       calH and calN in an analogous way to compC as in point 6, gChsqc
       manual).

    5. CALIBRATION OF dof2:  
       Set ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 and obtain a well=phased absorption mod
       1D spectrum. Set d2=0.0001 and phase=1,2, sum the two resulting spectra
       and display in exp5 with a 90 degree phase shift:
       clradd select(1) spadd select(2) spadd jexp5 full rp=rp+90 ds   
       dof2 will be in the middle of the NH region when the signals between
       7.4 and 9ppm in the 1H spectrum are roughly balanced between +ve and
       -ve signals.  Note that the same method with d2=0 should give a zero 
       spectrum.  Don't forget to reset d2=0 when you have finished.

    6. Splitting of resonances in the N15 dimension by C13 coupling in C13
       enriched samples can be removed by setting C13refoc='y'.

    7. H2O preservation is achieved according to Kay et al, except that a sinc
       one-lobe selective pulse is used to put H2O back along z.  This is much
       more selective than a hard, Seduce1, or gaussian pulse.  H2O is cycled
       back to z as much as possible during t1, and during the relaxation
       delays for the following relaxation time measurements.

    8. T1 MEASUREMENTS OF NH GROUPS:
       Implemented automatically by setting the flag T1='y'.  An array of 1D
       spectra is obtained by arraying the relaxation time parameter,
       relaxT, to a multiple of 10 milliseconds.  relaxT corresponds
       exactly to the relaxation time of the N15 spins.  The method uses 180
       degree H1 pulses every 5ms during relaxT as according to Kay et al.
       An alternative method using waltz decoupling was tested and discarded.
       It gave exactly the same results using alphalytic protease, but has 
       the comparative disadvantage of delivering more H1 RF, so more heating.

       2D spectra should be acquired in a separate run for each of the desired 
       values of relaxT. (maxrelaxT as in point 10 is not used when T1='y'.)

   10. T1rho MEASUREMENTS OF NH GROUPS:
       Implemented by setting the flag T1rho='y' and arraying relaxT as above.
       relaxT corresponds exactly to the relaxation time of the N15 spins.
       Spin lock power is limited to 1.5 kHz for a 600 Mhz spectrometer as
       this delivers about the same sample heating as the T2 method below.
       Increasing this RF (by changing the number 1500 in the DECLARE AND LOAD  
       VARIABLES section of gNhsqc.c) causes substantial sample or coil heating 
       as indicated by deterioration of the lock signal).  Care should be taken
       for relaxT times greater than 0.25 seconds, and times greater than
       0.5 seconds are automatically psg_aborted.  Gives very similar results
       to the T2 method as determined using alphalytic protease.  A dummy
       period of spinlock RF is delivered at the beginning of each pulse
       sequence to ensure constant average sample heating - the code
       determines this from the maximum relaxT you have set in your array of 
       relaxT. The spectrum at relaxT=0 may be erroneous because of insufficient
       dephasing of unlocked spins.

       2D spectra should be acquired in a separate run for each of the desired 
       values of relaxT.  If T1rho measurements are to be made in different
       experiments with different relaxTs as for 2D, including arrays of 
       relaxT's, set the parameter maxrelaxT to the maximum relaxT you have
       set in all experiments - this will ensure constant average sample
       heating in all experiments.  maxrelaxT does not need to be set for a
       single array in a single exp.

   11. T2 MEASUREMENTS OF NH GROUPS:
       Implemented by setting the flag T2='y' and arraying relaxT as above.
       relaxT corresponds exactly to the relaxation time of the N15 spins.
       As for T1rho, care should be taken for relaxT times greater than 0.25
       seconds, and times greater than 0.5 seconds are automatically psg_aborted.
       The method is according to Kay et al, with N15 180's every 625 us, and
       H1 180's every 10 ms.  625us was used instead of approx 500us used by
       Kay et al to reduce sample heating.  An alternative method using the
       same no. of N15 and H1 pulses for all relaxT times (by decreasing the
       625us delays to obtain short relaxT) to test whether large nos. of
       pulses decreases S/N because of pulse imperfection, gave exactly
       equivalent results for alphalytic protease, and was discarded.  Another
       alternative, with waltz H1 decoupling and a single N15 180 at the middle
       of relaxT (credited to Wagner et al by Kay et al), gave substantially
       shorter apparent T2 times, and was discarded.    A dummy period of N15
       180's is delivered at the beginning of each pulse sequence to ensure 
       constant average sample heating.

       2D spectra should be acquired in separate runs with maxrelaxT
       set as for T1rho='y' in point 10.       

   12. NH/NH2 GROUPS:
       A spectrum of NH2 groups, with NH groups cancelled, can be obtained
       with flag NH2only='y'.  This utilises a 1/2J (J=94Hz) period of NH 
       J-coupling evolution added to t1 which cancels NH resonances and 
       inverts NH2 resonances (normal INEPT behaviour).  A 180 degree phase
       shift is added to a N15 90 pulse to provide positive NH2 signals.
       The NH2 resonances will be smaller (say 80%) than when NH2only='n'.
       The flag NHonly='y' gives only NH.

   13. RELAXATION MEASUREMENTS OF NH2 GROUPS:
       NH2 resonances are supressed for the methods described in points 9-11.
       To obtain relaxation times of NH2 groups, set the flag NH2only='y' and
       proceed as for points 9-11.  In these cases the 1/2J delays described
       in points 8 and 12 are changed to 1/4J delays by the pulse sequence
       code.  Although NH groups are completely cancelled in point 12, when 
       measuring relaxation times NH groups appear at 50% intensity. 

   14. The coherence-transfer gradients using power levels
       gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 may be either z or magic-angle gradients. For the
       latter, a proper /vnmr/imaging/gradtable entry must be present and
       syscoil must contain the value of this entry (name of gradtable). The
       amplitude of the gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 should be lower than for a z axis
       probe to have the x and y gradient levels within the 32k range. For
       any value, a dps display (using power display) shows the x,y and z
       dac values. These must be <=32k.

   15. 1/4J DELAY TIMES:
       These are are determined from the NH coupling constant, JNH, listed in 
       dg for possible change by the user. lambda is the 1/4J time for H1 NH 
       coupling evolution, tNH is the 1/4J time for N15 NH coupling evolution.  
       lambda is usually set a little lower than the theoretical time to 
       minimise relaxation, but tNH should be as close to the theoretical time 
       as possible.

   16. TROSY and COUPLED 2D SPECTRA:
       Set TROSY='y' and dm2='nnn' for a TROSY spectrum of the bottom right
       peak of the 2D coupled quartet (high-field H1, low-field N15).  For
       comparison, TROSY='n' and dm2='nnn' gives a 2D spectrum coupled in
       both dimensions.  The TROSY spectrum retains the N15 magnetization as
       well as the H1 magnetization and so gives a little more than 50% S/N
       than decoupled HSQC for a small peptide.  For TROSY, H2O flipback is
       maintained throughout t1 and t2 using two sinc one-lobe pulses (H2O is 
       inverted for half of t1 for normal HSQC, ie TROSY='n' as described in 
       point 7).  To select any of the other three peaks of the 2D coupled
       quartet, in a clockwise direction from bottom right, change t4/t10
       from x/y to x/-y to -x/-y to -x/y.  NOTE, the Varian phases are of
       opposite sense to those in the Weigelt paper, ie swap y and -y.  The
       same phases as written by Weigelt also work provided the +/- gzlvl1
       signs for phase=1,2 are swapped to -/+, and the phase of one of the
       first two H1 90 degree pulses is swapped to ensure that the N15
       magnetization adds rather than subtracts.  The phase list used for
       this sequence code is yet another equivalent which permits the least
       change from the normal SE train in the BioPack sequences.
       Relaxation time measurements have not yet been implemented for TROSY
       spectra (requires customer demand !).

   17. Radiation Damping:
       At fields 600MHz and higher with high-Q probes, radiation damping is a
       factor to be considered. Its primary effect is in the flipback pulse
       calibration. Radiation damping causes a rotation back to the +Z axis
       even without a flipback pulse. Hence, the pwHs pulse often needs to 
       be reduced in its flip-angle. This can be accomplished by using the
       parameter tpwrsf_t. If this value is less than 4095.0 the value of tpwrs
       (calculated in the psg code) is increased by 6dB, thereby permitting
       the value of tpwrsf_t to be optimized to obtain minimum H2O in the 
       spectrum. The value of tpwrsf_t is typically lower than 2048 (half-maximum
       to compensate for the extra 6dB in tpwrs). 


       Added control of phase of flipback pulses via H2Osinc_t.RF after INEPT and
       H2Osinc_d.RF in TROSY. These pulses are generated by Pbox in the
       autocalibrate process and have internal small-angle phase corrections
       for best solvent suppression.
