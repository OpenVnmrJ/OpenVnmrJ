    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    Base-correlation from Uridine-imino to H6 or Cytidine-amino to H6 with
    options for the initial H->N transfer.

    H   -->   N   -->   C4   -->   C5   -->   C6   -->   H6 - det
    t1  CP        CP        INEPT      INEPT     re-INEPT
	or
	INEPT


                      NOTE dof MUST BE SET AT 110ppm ALWAYS
                      NOTE dof2 MUST BE SET AT 200ppm ALWAYS

    Experiment may not be feasible at >600 MHz because of power requirements.
    PSG will abort as a safety measure. 


    pulse sequence:	Simorre, J.P. et al, J. Biom. NMR, 6 (1995), 427-32.


                  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 13C decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [H1].

    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give 90, -180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in H1.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.



                  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF rna_CUhnccch


    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the RnaPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro:
                                      "printon man('RnaPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for rna_gChsqc may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('rna_CUhnccch') printoff".

    2. Apply the setup macro "rna_Chnccch" for the Cytidine and "rna_Uhnccch"
       for the Uridine correlation experiment.  This loads the relevant
       parameter set and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), N15 frequency on the aromatic N
       region (200 ppm), and C13 frequency on 110ppm.

    4. CHOICE of transfer and CYT/URA options:

       CP='y' uses CP for imino/amino H1 -> N15 transfer.
       ncyc_hn should be set to 1 or 2(at 500 MHz),~7.5msec, according to J(H-N) = 95Hz.

       INEPT='y' uses INEPT for imino/amino H1 -> N15 transfer.

       URA='y' gives a spectrum of uridine correlations.
       ncyc_nc should be set to 6(at 500 MHz),~90msec, according to J(N1-C4) = 10Hz.
       INEPT is generally better for uridine.		Set sw1 to 4ppm.

       CYT='y' gives a spectrum of cytidine correlations.
       ncyc_nc should be set to 3(at 500 MHz),~45msec, according to J(N4-C4) = 20Hz.
       CP is generally better for uridine.             Set sw1 to 4ppm.

    5. C13 COUPLING:
       Splitting of resonances in the t1 dimension by C13 coupling
       is removed by setting C13refoc='y'.

    6. GRADIENTS:
       G3 and G4 should be optimized for sufficient water suppression.
       Typical values are G3=12G/cm and G4:-28G/cm.

       G5 and G0 should be 2-3G/cm. 

       Gr suppresses radiation damping during t1 and should be 0.5 G/cm.

       In general, gradient-levels should be as low as possible.

    7. pw11-flag:

       Setting of pw11='y' replaces the first proton pulse by 
       an off resonance 1-1 type proton excitation pulse. This minimizes the
       excitation of H2O and allows to use lower gradient levels.
       Overall, setting pw11='y' leads to a slight loss in S/N.
