/* wgroesy.c - rotating frame NOE experiment with T-Roesy modification 
                   allows T-Roesy or standard cw Roesy
                   WATERGATE version

             OBSERVE TRANSMITTER SHOULD BE SET AT SOLVENT POSITION
             SATURATION,SPIN LOCK AND PULSES ALL USE OBS.XMTR

        p1 = 90 degree pulse on protons (power level at "p1lvl")
        pw = 90 degree spin lock pulse at tpwr (active only if T_flg='y')
     p1lvl = power level for the p1 pulse
      tpwr = power level for the spin lock pulse(s)
    flippw = long pulse on water during echo
    flippwr = pwrlvl for flippw
   phincr2 = small angle phase shift for flippw
     T_flg= 'y' gives pulsed T-Roesy; 'n': cw Roesy
     phase = 1,2: F1 quadrature by the hypercomplex method
       mix = mixing time
     sspul = 'y': activates gradient-90degree-gradient pulse prior to d1
    gzlvl1 = gradient level for sspul
       gt1 = gradient duration foe sspul
        nt = min:  multiple of 4; max:  multiple of 8

   Use of any method to make lp1=0 will result in a dc offset of F1 slices. This
   should be removed by dc2d('f1') after the 2d transform. Enough noise should 
   be left on the edges (in F1) to permit this dc correction.
