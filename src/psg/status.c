|	status(index)/1

|	This index is used in conjucntion with the status control
|	variables like dm,dmm: where dm='yny' then status(B) sets the
|	global statusindx = 1; therefore when dm is check the 2nd character
|	is used as its value.
|	If the index is out of range then it is set to the first char
