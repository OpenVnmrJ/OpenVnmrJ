Patch Description: 4.2_LNX_ANY_504
----------------------------------
This is a patch that adds accounting features to allow non-interactive use.
See /vnmr/manual/vnmr_accounting for details.
A model doAcct script is included. A cron job could be setup. As vnmr1,
to schedule accounting at 5AM on the first of every month, run
  crontab -e
and input the line

  0  5  1  * * /vnmr/bin/doAcct

The results of the accounting will be stored in the ~vnmr1/vnmrsys/accounting/<yyyy_mm_dd>
directory, where yyyy_mm_dd is the day the doAcct script was run. For example, the directory may be
  ~vnmr1/vnmrsys/accounting/2018_07_01
