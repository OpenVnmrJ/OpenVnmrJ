# '@(#)p_install '
# 
#

# The p_install file is an optional file called by patchinstall.
# The patchinstall script installs the content of the patch. This file
# is used to handle miscellanous tasks, such as removing files, changing
# permissions on files, etc.

# The parameter $vnmrsystem will be set. Its typical value will be /vnmr
# The parameter $tmp_save is the directory into which any files should be put.

# Files should not be deleted, but moved to the $tmp_save directory.
# That way, patchuninstall can move the file back. The commented example
# illustrates removing a macro.

# if [ ! -d $tmp_save/maclib ]
# then
#    mkdir -p $tmp_save/maclib
# fi
# mv $vnmrsystem/maclib/macroA $tmp_save/maclib/macroA

# The patchinstall script may run fixpsg and display messages about
# rebooting the console or restarting the acquisition communication
# programs (the "procs"). Setting the following three variables to
# yes will select those actions. This is typically done automatically
# by the patchinstall script. You can also set them to "no" to turn of
# the actions.

# fix_psg="yes"
# reboot="yes"
# su_acqproc="yes"
# Do fixpsg here to suppress warnings from clang compiler on newer MacOS versions
fix_psg="no"
# su_acqproc="no"


# If an action cannot be undone by reloading the contents of the
# saved patch directory back onto $vnmrsystem (/vnmr), then an
# appropriate action should be saved in the p_uninstall script to undo
# the action. For example, lets say the permissions on bin fileX
# are 644 and they should be 664. The following will accomplish that.
# Another example is renaming bin fileA to fileB.

# chmod 664 $vnmrsystem/bin/fileX
# printf "chmod 644 $vnmrsystem/bin/fileX\n" >> $tmp_save/p_uninstall

# mv $vnmrsystem/bin/fileA $vnmrsystem/bin/fileB
# printf "mv $vnmrsystem/bin/fileB $vnmrsystem/bin/fileA\n" >> $tmp_save/p_uninstall
