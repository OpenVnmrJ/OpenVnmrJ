This patch is for Agilent NMR Systems running VnmrJ 4.2A
It is for VNMRS, 400MR, DD2, 400MR-DD2, and ProPulse systems.
It is not for MercuryVx, MercuryPlus, or Inova systems.
There is a separate patch for those systems.
It can also be installed on "virtual machine" based datastation software.
It cannot be installed on the native MacOS version of VJ42.

Installation instructions:
--------------------------
 - The acquisition processes need be stopped to install this patch (su acqproc).
 - Any executing VnmrJ processes must be exited.
 - You must install this patch as the VnmrJ administrator (typically vnmr1).
 - To install the patch, use
        patchinstall 4.2_LNX_DDR_108.ptc
   (you may also use an absolute file path).
 - After the patch installation is complete, you will need to run setacq.
 - After the patch installation is complete, you will need to run vnmrj adm and
   update user accounts
