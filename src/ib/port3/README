This directory contains the .f files that were used to create the corresponding
.c files in the (parent) ib directory. Conversion from .f to .c is done by
the "f2c" program available on netlib: http://www.netlib.org/f2c/

Currently, this directory is not used in the build; the .c files are treated
as the sources for the build.

Since the .f files are the original sources, the .c files should logically be
removed from the Git repo and the SConstruct file modified to create them on
the fly from these .f files.
